M:    So you called him Ginger and fleabag.
J:    Fleabag, ‘go away fleabag!’ Used to go mad at him, always clawing. I
       had a guinea pig when I was really little. Me dad hated that as well.
I:    Oh no [laugh]
J:    Mm. He died.
M:    How could he hate a guinea pig?
J:    He just used to hate him, he used to say he was dead noisy. But that
       was from when I was really little, when I lived in [anon]. And I left
       there when I was seven or eight, I think I was. I remember the hutch
       in the back- in the back yard next to the toilet. Cos we had an
       outside toilet.
I:    Oh [laugh]
J:    [laugh] (2.5) yeah, Squeaks.

       bedroom and then there was my bedroom and then there was a wall with
       a  door in that me dad put up and there was a toilet in there.
       Upstairs but you had to come through my bedroom to get to the toilet.
M:    So you used to have an ensuite?
I     [laugh]
J:    [laugh] Yeah.
M:    So whilst the only person in the country with ensuite was the Queen,
I:    [laugh
M:     you also had one?
J:    It was the toilet upstairs. Definitely. With glass at the top and
       this studded wall. Horrible it was.
M:    So an inside toilet was horrible? While I’m going outside
I:    [laugh]
M:    in the depths of winter.
J:    Did you not have an inside toilet?
M:    No we didn’t have an inside toilet no.
J:    That toilet that you’ve got now? That’s an inside toilet.
M:    I can remember it- that’s- that’s a- that’s an inside toilet that’s
       been turned round from the outside.
TIME [18.00]
J:    oh right.
M:    Originally that was an outside toilet. With red walls that had been
       speckled with paint, like you’d do in school. To splash on the paper.


I:    [laugh]
J:    [laugh]
M:    And that’s what we used to have. With a nail.
J:    Get lost!
M:    Nail.
J:    You’ll be saying newspaper next.
M:    And newspaper. Newspaper.
J:    No you did not.
M:    Cut up into sheets.
J:    That’s not true!
M:    That’s true. Izal.
J:    Oh we used to have, Izal.
M:    Don’t sound proud of it!
J:    Izal was-
M:    It’s nothing to be proud of, to have Izal.
J:    Izal was paper.
I:    oh
J:    It was horrible. It was, you had to scrunch it all up first. Oh it
       was nasty.
M:    That was luxu- that was luxury, we had- when we had the Izal in that
       was like our luxury, rather than the newspaper. That was like a good
       day. If you went in there and there was Izal in there that was like,
       ‘yeah it must be pay day.’
I:    [laugh]
J:    [laugh] We were posher than Martin [anon] in our family

M:    You’ll have come from [anon], you couldn’t have been- oh no you did
       have two toilets didn’t you?
I:    [laugh]
J:    Yes we did and we went to Majorca
I:    ooh
J:    when I was little. With me [anon] and [anon] on a plane and I was
       about eight or nine. And I remember sitting next to the pool eating
       calamari.

M:    And eat calamari.
J:    Only one foreign holiday.
M:    I bet you were drinking wine as well, wasn’t you?
J:    No, no that was when I was a bit older cos like I say with being
       Mediterranean in the family, we all had wine. Two fingers

J:    two fingers of wine in the glass, topped up with lemonade or water.
I:    ahh
J:    mm
M:    And there’s me being dragged off to me bleeding grandmas in Windsor,
       into a tower block.
I:    aww, ahh, [laugh]
J:    [laugh] Really?
M:    Yeah, really yeah. The old fifth floor of a tower block or something.
       That was my summer holidays.
J:    That was only one, with me [anon] and me [anon] that I remember that
       early.
M:    Unless it was every year, this.
J:    No we didn’t get holiday every year. Isle of Man.
M:    Wasn’t an holiday it was like punishment.
J:    I remember going to the Isle of Man. [laugh]

       they said.
I:    [laugh]
J:    [laugh]
M:    But yeah, enjoyed it (2.5) Not Windsor, I didn’t, that’s a bit
       rubbish.
J:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
M:    Well other than going round the castle, the castle was alright.
I:    mm
M:    Just me and me younger brother then so I wouldn’t be bullied all the
       time.
I:    [laugh]
M;    Remember having a bath once with my sister, well I wasn’t bathing
       with my sister. That would be a bit weird, wouldn’t it?
I:    [laugh]
TIME [22.00]
M:    But she bathed me, I don’t know, she would’ve been quite old as well,
       maybe twelve or thirteen. Twelve probably I’d have been about eight.
       And for a laugh she poured sco- scolding water on me head.
I:    [gasp]
J:    [laugh]
M:    I don’t know if it was cold water first or hot water. But whatever it
       was, she told me to stop complaining and put the other one on top of
       me head afterwards.
J:    [laugh] Oh god [gasp] [laugh].
M:    It’s no wonder I’m a twisted individual I suppose.
I:    [laugh]
M:    See that’s my childhood, see?
J:    You had a terrible childhood didn’t you?
I:    [laugh]
M:    Yeah so did your [anon]. So did your brother. Being bullied by you,
       that’s how he-
J:    Oh my god it was a bit of a flipping-
I:    [laugh]
M:    That’s how he feels. I’m sure that’s how he feels. That’s why he’s
       gone to America.
I:    [gasp] Aww [laugh].
M:    Because he had to leave because he couldn’t stay in this country any
       more.
J:    Do you know what I did do which was really bad? This is terrible
       this. He bought my mum- there used to be a chocolate bar called a
       nutty. And it- it was like caramel-
TIME [23.00]
M:    That sounds attractive that.
I:    [laugh]
J:    [laugh] that’s what they were called, do you remember nuttys?
M:    No, could never afford chocolates.
J:    And it was caramel [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
J:    and it was wrapped in like peanuts and he bought it me mum for
       mother’s day and kept it in the cupboard. He bought it with his
       spends. And I’ll never forget, oh I can’t believe I did this, but I
       stole it and I ate it.
I:     [gasp]
J:    Cos I wanted this chocolate bar so, so much. And I denied all
       knowledge for- it was up until a couple of years ago.
I:    Really? [laugh]
J:    I told him the truth. He always used to say to me, ‘you did take that
       nutty, didn’t you?’ And I used to go, ‘no I didn’t!’ and I did.
I:    [laugh] aww
J:    And it was only a few years ago when- cos I go and visit him maybe
       once a year. Or once every two years, I can’t-
I:    yeah
J:    and I told him the truth. And he was really upset with me.
I:    Yeah, was he?
J:    Yeah, cos he
I:    aww
M:    Well he would be. Cos all he wanted to do as a child was please his
       mum.
J:    Yeah give-
I:    [laugh]
J:    give it her for mother’s day.
M:    All I wanted to do was please my mum, make cakes with my mum, and I
       got teased and ridiculed.
TIME [24.00]
M:    And all he wanted to do was buy his mum a chocolate bar. And give it
       for mother’s day, was it?
J:    Yeah.
I:    Aww.
M:    And then somebody nasty and older went and spoilt it.
J:    I got her milk tray.
M:    Spoilt his special day.
J:    It’s terrible.
M:    His day with his mum.
J:    And I can- I remember I got my mum a box of milk tray and you got a
       free happy mother’s day card with it. And when she died she still-
       when we were going through all her stuff, we found it, she’d kept it
       all that time.
I:    Really, aww that’s nice.
J:    All that time, she kept it. And this little card as well, best mum in
       the world. Couldn’t believe she kept it all that time.
M:    She probably was quite- I dunno, a bit er- surprised that you’d been
       so nice for once.
I:    [laugh]
J:    [laugh] I was a very nice daughter.
M:    Cos she’d probably see all the things that you did to your brother
       and- but you continued to- well you always liked chocolate didn’t
       you?
J:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
M:    Doing things with chocolate
TIME [25.00]
M:    I know it’s not about childhood because you know, when- when I had my
       easter egg.
J:    [laugh] oh don’t tell her that!
I:    [laugh]
M:    Remember I had my easter egg? When we were married. And you got me an
       easter egg.
J:    Yes.
M:    On easter Sunday morning.
J:    Yes I remember.
M:    And I’d had it about two minutes
I:    [laugh]
M:    and you went all moody,
I:    aww [laugh]
M:    and stamped on it, stamped on it like a little child in front of me,
       didn’t you?
J:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
M:    Stamping your feet over and over again until the easter egg was
       crushed. Didn’t you?
I:    Why? [laugh]
J:    [laugh] I can’t remember now. I can’t remember why.
M:    You can’t rememb- you can’t remember doing it, oh did you blank it
       out?
J:    No I can remember, I can remember doing it very clearly.
M:    you blank it out, that’s what I tried to do when-, I tried to blank
       it out when nasty things happen to you, that’s what you try to do.
I:    [laugh] aww
J:    Oh I can’t-
M:    but, yeah
J:    I can’t remember why I did that now. Why you annoyed me so much.
M:    mm, I have my ideas why you did it but-.
J:    Why, tell me why! Cos you didn’t get me one?
M:    I don’t think that was the reason.
TIME [26.00]
J:    I can’t remember.
M:    I think it’s just about your wiring, isn’t it?
J:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
J:    Er where are your parents from? Oh we’ve established that really,
       haven’t we?
M:    Well my dad’s not [anon] is he?
J:    No go on! Where are your parents from?
M:    That’s if they are my parents.
J:    [laugh] oh God
I:    [laugh]
M:    I always had the feeling I was adopted because there was- I took so
       much abuse when I was a child.
J:    [laugh]
M:    I always felt there was something different about me.
J:    ah
I:    ah
M:    As if I’d been abused, not abused but as if I’d been- I’d come from
       somewhere else.
J:    But you and your brother are spitting image of each other!
I:    [laugh]
M:    I know but it wasn’t like that when I was a kid.
J:    With your big freaky head.
M:    They used to- they used to say I had a big head, yeah.
J:    He had a huge head.
I:    Oh really?
J:    Yeah with the biggest afro you’ve ever seen in your life, it used to

TIME [27.00]
J:    [laugh]
M:    [laugh]
J:    your brother told me!

J:    He said your head- your afro was that big it used to wave in the
       wind.
I:    [laugh]
M:    But if it was windy, what if it wasn’t windy?
J:    I don’t know. So where’s your dad from?

I:    [laugh]
M:    From living in [anon]?
J:    There was a toilet upstairs, there was a toilet upstairs.
M:    How did he move from [anon] to [anon] then? To the slums of [anon]?
J:    It was not a slum!
I:    [laugh]
M:    It was a slum, that was why you moved cos they pulled it down.
J:    Knocking the houses down, because my dad used to work for a company
       called [anon].
TIME [28.00]
J:    Erm and I think the houses, I’m not- I’m not too sure about that. I
       know all the houses were originally built for the factories weren’t
       they, that were there. For the factory workers. But I’m sure it was
       my mum and dad’s house. You know I’m pretty sure it was and they
       moved us to [anon]. Cos they were pulling them all down.
I:    mm, ah
J:    But they didn’t pull them down for about five years, did they?
M:    No.
J:    Moved everybody out and then didn’t pull them down
I:    [laugh].
M:    Well they put Asians in them didn’t they?

       street with our prams. Playing cricket in the entry. Couldn’t play
       cricket now but [laugh] [inc].
I:    [laugh]
M:    How do you play- how do you play cricket without ca- being able to
       catch a ball?
TIME [29.00]
J:    I can catch a ball.

J:    And it was splashing all the water in your face.
I:    yeah
J:    Well you’re like that shutting your eyes, and you can’t catch a ball
       with your eyes shut.

J:    Him and [anon] played for-.
M:    [inc] extreme.
I:    mm
J:    Throwing it at each other.
I:    yeah
J:    Pathetic.
I     [laugh]
J:    For about an hour, nearly put your shoulder out.
I:    [laugh]
M:    But that was the thing, catch the ball (3.5)
J:    So yes I can catch a ball (2.0)
M:    Shall we move on now, do you want to move on?
J:    [laugh]

TIME [30.00]
M:    You had nice catholic schools, didn’t you?
J:    I did.
M:    That must’ve been nice.

J:    Oh that’s okay. [laugh]
M:    I was only kidding her.
I:    [laugh]
J:    She’s- she was terrible. She’s really, really evil. Used to- she had
       a knack, she used to throw the board rubber and she used to get you
       every time.
I:    ooh
J:    It just- it- there had to be complete silence in the classroom and if
       you dared ask someone next to you for a pencil or-

       corner- there was a teacher called er (0.5) [anon] (1.0) and your
       nose had to be on the wall, like that which- just stand there, all
       through the lesson. Until she was ready for you to sit back down.
I:    God
J:    She was evil, horrible woman, horrible.
TIME [31.00]

TIME [32.00]
J:    [laugh] Is that not a bully?
M:    Didn’t bully them, no I didn’t bully them.
J:    You used to batter anyone?

I:    [laugh]
J:    And you were the top of the pack, were you?
M:    Mm, top bit of it, yeah.
J:    [laugh]
M:    Top ten percent. That’s just the way school was. Bit like that in
       life.
I:    [laugh]
J:    Suppose yeah, it is.
M:    Do you remember your first day at school? (2.0)
J:    No.
M:    I bet you had shiny shoes on, didn’t you?
I:    aww
M:    New shiny shoes.

M:    Do you now- do you er- bring back your old favourites? You know, the

       same stuff for the children that you’re cooking for now?
J:    Yeah, things like rice pudding, tapioca, erm lemon sponge and
       custard. Chocolate sponge with mint custard, that’s one of the
       favourites.
M:    Do you think the chemicals in the mint custard-
I:    [laugh]
TIME [35.00]
M:    Do you think they could affect children?
J:    Er no it’s a mint- it’s a mint erm essence.
M:    where-
J:    It’s a pure- pure mint essences we use.
M:    Where do they get the luminous green colour from?
I:    [laugh]
J:    Erm it’s a food colourant. Yeah but we use one teaspoon for four
       gallons of custard.
M:    That must be pretty powerful stuff.
I:    yeah
J:    It is cos it only ever hi- hi- a tinge of green, if I make it too
       green, they won’t have it.
M:    Do you think if you ate a spoonful of that green colouring,
J:    mm, mm
M:    do you think you’d turn green?
I:    [laugh]
J:    If you took it neat?
M:    Yeah.
J:    I’m sure it would do irreparable damage to your insides.

M:    What about your skin tone though?
J:    But watered down-
I:    [laugh]

       colourant in carrots, that it is in tanning tablets and that’s what
       makes you go brown.
TIME [36.00]
I:    mm
J:    If you take enough of them, yeah (2.0)
M:    Do you think that there’s Martians somewhere that- I dunno, on some
       planet outer universe, that are green coloured, but only light green,
       that they might take this green food colouring to tan them up.
I:    [laugh].
M:    Do you think there’d be same type of-?
J:    You’re very weird.
I:    [laugh]
M:    Tablets for martians?
J:    no.
M:    So like you’d be like a light green martian but you’re thinking, ‘I
       want to look like I’ve been on my holidays, so I’ll take a little
       mouthful of Janice’s [anon] special green food colouring and that’ll
       green me up.’
J:    No I don’t.
I:    [laugh] just no
J:    yeah, that’s a very, very weird thing to ask.
I:    [laugh]

       minced beef cobbler they like.
