M:    we know where we went to school.
No left channel (Vivienne)
M:    We went to the same school.
V:    We went to [anon] school.
M:    it was. Now did you ever get into trouble at school? Can you
      remember?
V:    I did get into trouble once, it was something to do with a bird.
M:    Really?
V:    And someb- I think the boy that got me into trouble, somebody called
      [anon] who lived on [anon].
M:    mmhmm
V:          But I can’t remember exactly how it all came about.
I:    [laugh]
V:    But I know [anon] wasn’t very happy.
I:    oh
M:    Ah. Well I remember getting into trouble at that school and I got the
      cane.

TIME [01.00]
M:    Did you?

M:    I was late, I’ve never been late in my life, and I still hate being
      late for anything.
V:    Well I’m-.
M:    And I dawdled on the way to school and suddenly I realised that the
      doors were locked and I couldn’t get in. And I had to stand waiting
      while they did the prayers.
V:    How old were you then?
M:    Erm I was in the junior school, so possibly about eleven. Ten or
      eleven. And I got the- this cane on my l- on my hand
V:    who gave you that? [anon]?
M:    [anon] and it was-
V:    He was a bit handy with his cane, wasn’t he?
M:    And do you know it really hurt, it- and I was so mortified that I had
      to stand there in the hall and be caned.
Section omitted due to recording problem
M:    Difficult years to be a child in.
V:    Yes.
M:    Erm wondering from one day to the next whether the Germans would

TIME [02.00]
V:    Cos we had shelters didn’t we?
M:    We did at school, which we had to go into.
V:    Yes.
M:    And practice for air-raids.
V:    yes, air raids, mm
M:    I got thumped in one of those, I remember, very, very hard in the
      dark.
V:    Really?
M:    Somebody thumped me, we never knew who it was. But er-.
V:    Well you wouldn’t in the dark, no
M:    No [laugh].
V:    But I quite enjoyed [anon].
M:    I did actually. It was a church school.
V:    Yes.
M:    It was always a very good school. But as far as favourite teacher
      goes erm-.
Left channel (Maureen) resumes
V:    Was there one called [anon]?
M:    Yes.
V:    I think she was a favourite.
M:    Yes possibly, she came from Irlam.
V:    That’s right.
M:    Mm, she did.
V:    [anon] with the strap in the corner.
M:    oh
V:    She used to frighten me to death. But she was a very, very good
      teacher. Was her name [anon]?
M:    Right.
V:    She used to play the piano.
M:    I don’t remember that name.
V:    And if we didn’t sing- she taught us ‘Jerusalem’ and if we didn’t
      sing it correctly, oh my word! She was very strict.
TIME [03.00]
No right channel (Maureen)
M:    right, right, I remember [anon]. Now she was extremely strict.
V:     [anon].
M:    Very strict lady. She was a large lady and she was very, very strict,
      everyone was frightened of her.
V:    Well I think-.
M:    As far as your first day at school, that school- I actually, had been
      up in the lake district cos I’d been evacuated erm to my aunt’s. And I
      do not remember really my first day at school but I do remember at the
      infants. And I do remember you and [anon] with your lovely dark black
      hair
V:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
M:    that was cut you know, with your fringes. I remember looking and
      thinking, ‘ooh what lovely hair!’
V:    I remember my first day. Cos I was five when I went.
Right channel (Maureen) resumes)
M:    Right.
V:    And I think the teacher was called [anon]
M:    oh
V:    And I can picture the classroom.
TIME [04.00]
V:    And our [anon] younger than me, she cried because she wanted to come
      as well. So she started as well, shortly afterwards.
No right channel (Maureen)
M:    Oh, oh right.
V:    Erm- but then our [anon] had appendicitis
M     did she
V:    and she was rushed to hospital.
M:    Right.
V:    And she missed quite a bit of schooling because of it.
M:    ooh, cos it was a big operation.
V:    It was in those days, yes. Cos they were frightened it might be
      peritonitis.
M:    Yes.
V:    Because [anon], my dad’s sister, she had died at fourteen
M:    oh right
V:    with peritonitis. Erm (1.2) and we always felt that she never quite
      caught up, because she missed-.
M:    So much.
V:    The grounding, you know, the basics. She’s alright now but that’s the
      way we felt.
Right channel (Maureen) resumes
M:    mm, mm, summer holidays for me were again, back in the Lake District.


V:    yes, yeah
M:    Erm I used to go on [inc].
V:    We used to go on coach trips, Stratford upon Avon.
M:    Yes, yes
TIME [05.00]
V:    Erm I didn’t go to Scarborough. Erm, round Wales.
M:    Right.
V:    Me dad used to take us to New Brighton on the bus.
M:    Oh right.
V:    But that’s as far as it went in those days, cos people didn’t go on
      holiday, did they really?
M:    mm, no they didn’t no. Well you couldn’t because there was no seaside
      to go to, because it was mined, all the beaches. I do remember going
      to Blackpool once.
V:    Yes I remember Blackpool.
M:    And it was all barbed wire and you weren’t allowed on the beach to
      play. Erm I presume it was all mined and you know, waiting for an
      invasion.
V:    mm, mm
M:    So beaches were just you know-.
V:    A no go area.
M:    No go areas yes. Yes.
V:    But having said that, I mean- our school days- we never went short.
      We were never short of food or anything like that.
M:    No, it wasn’t very good at times.
V:    We made the most of what we had, erm
M:    Yes and I still hate celery.
I:    [laugh]
V:    I’ve never really taken to celery.
M:    raw celery, I hate, but I love it in stews. I do actually like it.
V:    Do you?
M:    Yes, in stews.
TIME [06.00]
V:    I eat it because [anon] puts it in
M:    yes
V:    but I can’t say that it’s one of me favourite things.
M:    Yes, no. But I think- I think it was very difficult for our parents
      to feed- I mean, there were th- three of us, ‘til [anon] was born.
V:    mm
M:    had my sister, in nineteen forty four, so- it was hard to- everything
      was so rationed.
V:    It was.
M:    It was dreadful, you queued for everything.
V:    Everything.
M:    you ate
V:    And sweets, when you think nowadays the shops are absolutely full of
      them.
M:    Yes, yes.
V:    I suppose we were lucky that erm my aunties were still at home and
      they gave us their sweet coupons.
M:    Sweet coupons, yes.
V:    And we used to go to [anon].
M:    Oh yes, yes.
V:    And er the main thing we had were Barley sugars.
M:    Oh gosh, really?
V:    And occasionally a treat, with a crunchie.
M:    mm
V:    But it was- that was all you could get in those days.
M:    mm
V:    And then there was the powdered egg,
TIME [07.00]
V:    powdered milk
M:    Oh gosh that American powdered egg.
V:    Canned coffee, ooh.
M:    We w- we were very lucky, we had erm- my grandfather wrote to a lady
      in America who had been the fiancée of an uncle.
M:    Who died in the first world war.
V:    mm, mm
M:    And she went out and married someone else. And went out to America
      and she sent us food parcels, all the way through the war.
V:    Oh that was nice, yeah.
M:    She was very religious and the church that she went to, they
      collected for the English people.
V:    Really?
M:    And they used to send us some wonderful things over.
V:    yeah
M:    Erm and it must’ve been quite expensive to get it over in those days,
V:    over in tho- yes
M:    they wouldn’t be flown over.
V:    No, no.
M:    It would’ve come by boat.
V:    It’d take weeks!
M:    The only thing I hated was the wintergreen sweets that they sent.
V:    Oh I don’t remember those. I never had those.
M:    Oh they were dreadful, they were American, wintergreen, and the
      chocolate was bad as well.
V:    Urgh.
M:    And I- I never liked those.
V:    Well even now I don’t think their chocolate is as nice as ours.
M:    I don’t, no.
TIME [08.00]
V:    Because [anon] and [anon] love Thorntons,
M:    mm, mm
V:    [anon] in particular you know, the erm special toffee. And when me
      mum used to visit erm [anon] in Chicago.
M:    mm, mm
V:    Take some decent cadburies chocolates.
M:    yes, yes, yes.
V:    yes not as nice as hours.
M:    But they used to send- also, they collected clothes.
V:    mm
M:    Clothes that were practically new. And I absolutely hated them.
      Because my mother cut them down,
V:    [laugh]
M:    to fit me and they were American style sleeves.
V:    yes and you felt different.
M:    And I was different at school in them. And I absolutely hated them.
V:    I don’t remember that Maureen [anon]. I don’t remember.
M:    And they were beautiful things, I’m sure.
V:    Yes, yes, mm
M:    But they weren’t what I wanted. But there were no clothes.
V:    I know, well-.
M:    Very difficult to get.
V:    Cos I know when people got married- I th- [anon] got married at the
      end of the war, and it wasn’t a white outfit, it was sort of a two
      piece,
M:    mm, mm
TIME [09.00]
V:    with a great big hat.
M:    Hats, mm.
V:    She always wore a hat didn’t she?
M:    mm, Well I- I remember my mother making my eldest sister- half
      sister, erm, wedding cake. That would be probably nineteen- [anon] was
      born in forty four, so this would be forty five, I think.
V:    mm
M:    And my mum- my mother had got all the cake mixture, black market cake
      mixture of course.
V:    Yes, yes
M:    Erm and she made this wedding cake and she took it out of the oven
      and it fell into three pieces.
I:    [laugh] oh no
V:    [laugh] oh your poor mum!
M:    And she was absolutely horrified because she’d been a cook, that was
      her- what she did as a young woman,
V:    mm
M:    and I think she got the almond paste and stuck it together.
V:    ‘gether [laugh].
I:    [laugh]
M:    Where the cracks were. And iced over it and nobody knew any
      different.
V:    knew
TIME [10.00]
M:    So that- but that stuck in my mind and yes, that’s amazing.
V:    Yes, yes.
M:    Erm but I used to- I did a lot of the queuing fo- for food.
V:    But we had to do, didn’t we?
M:    Yes because my mother had obviously had my sister in nineteen forty
      four
V:    mm
M:    and I used to go and do all the-.
V:    I did the er- most of the errands.
M:    Did you do it as well Vivienne [anon]?
V:    Yes
M:    mm
V:    [anon].
M:    Yes.
V:    Cake shop
M:    yes
V:    and we used to go to [anon] on the other side of the trinity. Erm-.
M:    Mm, yes.
V:    And everything you know was sort of weighed and very precise.
M:    Oh absolutely. When you watch these- I love the history programmes
V:    mm
M:    and I do watch them and you know, what went on in the war years. And
      they’re absolutely perfect because you know, they are true footage.
V:    I know.
M:    Of what it was like and it makes you think, ‘how did we ever
      survive?’
V:    Well we did, didn’t we?
M:    mm
V:    We never went short. Never went short.
M:    No, we had probably just about enough but er-.
TIME [11.00]
V:    Yes [inc] and yet it’s not done us any harm, has it? When you think
      about it.
M:    Well we’re still here at seventy four and touch our toes, Vivienne
      [anon].
V:    [laugh] I don’t know that I can touch my toes.
M:    mm, I can.
V:    Can you?
M:    Yes. Oh gosh yes.
V:    Mind you I’ve never tried but I’m sure I can’t.
M:    No [laugh]
V:    I’m sure I can’t. Oh dear.
M:    yeah, yeah, well we’ve got our own teeth.
V:    Oh I haven’t.
M:    Oh sorry [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    Well I have half, the bottom. But I had mine out at twenty six.
M:    Oh did you?
V:    Because I had terrible teeth.
M:    Oh right, right.
V:    Look at her laughing!
I:    [laugh] I know
V:    Terrible teeth.
M:    We’ve got our own hair colour!
V:    Oh yeah and- well-.
M:    Well yes!
V:    With a bit of help [laugh]
M:    The hairdresser’s very helpful [laugh]
V:    Absolutely. Erm, yes.
M:    Erm you know and what else? Well I’ve got contact lenses. I fool
      everyone cos I’ve got contact lenses.
V:    Ooh no I just- I couldn’t put those in, I couldn’t mess with my eyes.
M:    Oh gosh yes, yeah
V:    I couldn’t.
M:    I’ve had them about- oh I don’t know, twenty five years, probably
      now.
V:    Really?
M:    mm, since I- I’m more-.
V:    I need my glasses for reading but I just couldn’t-
TIME [13.00]
M:    yes, mm
V:    if I had to wear them all the time, I’d have to wear them. Just
      couldn’t put contact lenses in. [anon] does. But I couldn’t.
M:    Erm, well my grandson who’s eleven, well twelve tomorrow. He use- he
      has contact lenses, [anon].
V:    Does he?
M:    And what a difference it’s made to his life, and I taught him how to
      do it.
V:    Oh I’m sure. Really, yes.
M:    Yes, and erm I did explain it and I keep saying, you know, ‘you must
      wash your hands, all the time!’
V:    Ooh hands going near your eyes.
M:    You don’t want to get infected eyes. And I spent a long time- .
V:    mm, Explaining it to him.
M:    Explaining how to do it, and do you know, he- he was brilliant.
V:    mm
M:    And he’s so thrilled because he doesn’t have to wear glasses any
      more.
V:    yes.
I:    mm
M:    Yes, made a big difference to him at school.
V:    Because children generally don’t like wearing glasses.
M:    They’re quite cruel aren’t they? Some of them.
V:    Oh they are yes. Yes that’s right.
M:    But yes.
V:    I mean on the whole I think my school days were happy days.
M:    Yes I’m sure mine were really, yes.
TIME [13.00]
V:    But then after [anon] we parted company didn’t we?
M:    We did Vivienne [anon] you went to the grammar school.
V:    I went to [anon] school.

V:    School choir. But I m- that’s a bit like that now. All gone by the
      board.
M:    No [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
M:    I think they just had netball at [anon] when I went there.
V:    Did they? Well they had netball but I-
M:    mm
V:    I think being on the short side, I wasn’t very good at netball.
M:    No, no.
V:    I was better at hockey.
M:    You are better when you’re tall, yes.
V:    And yet funny, my best friend, who was taller than me, you know,
      [anon].
M:    Yes oh yes.
V:    She was good at the high jump. I did the long jump. She did netball,
      I did hockey. We just did opposite things.
M:    mm, mm, yes.
V:    And I think that’s partly to do with her being so much taller than
      me.
M:    Taller, yes, yes.
I:    mm
V:    mm
M:    mm.
TIME [14.00]

M:    And as far as brothers and sisters of course, I had- my father sadly
      lost his first wife with consumption as they called it in those days.
      Er in nineteen twenty nine or stroke thirty. Erm my sister was three.
      And my brother was a baby, about six months old.
V:    mm, mm
M:    And my father was working, because of all the problems with like
      today, jobs that are difficult.
V:    Yes.
M:    And of course the twenties and thir- well the twenties was very
      difficult. And he went to live in Yorkshire. And-.
V:    yeah- whereabouts in Yorkshire?
M:    Well I can’t just remember now, though I’m trying very hard to. There
      was a very large erm- water supply, a big erm-.
V:    Reservoir.
TIME [15.00]
M:    Yes and it f- I think it fed Leeds I think, up there, but it’s
      beautiful up there. And they had-.
V:    Is it the reservoir that you see when you’re on the M-sixty two?
      Going towards-.
M:    No, no it isn’t.
V:    no
M:    Erm and I have photographs of my father up a telegraph pole, cos he
      was electrician.
V:    Oh was he?
M:    Wiring it all up. And they had houses as well, and that- my sister
      took me about four or five years ago and the foundations of the houses
      which were stone were still there. Just the foundations,
V:    mm
M:    you could see where they were. Erm and the water authority, it hadn’t
      been open actually to the public and they’d o-
V:    mm
M:    they’d o- they’d only just opened this particular spot.
V:    mm
M:    Erm and so it was quite you know, interesting to go.
V:    Yes, yes.
M:    And obviously my father’s been dead twenty years now. Erm but-.
V:    Do you know I thought it would’ve been more than that, Maureen
      [anon].
M:    My father?
V:    Mm.
M:    Erm, well my mother- father twen-
TIME [16.00]
M:    mother twenty and my father twenty two I think.
V:    Really? Mm.
M:    And then what happened, she got this consumption living there. Sadly
      and had to go to er a sanatorium. And he took his two children back to
      Windermere where he came from.
V:    mm
M:    And his mother looked after them.
V:    Looked after them, brought them up.
M:    And that’s how he met my mother

V:    another little girl, Yes.

      choir, like [anon] was in the choir.

M:    Oh, yes, that’s- it is, probably were, yes.
V:    But you and [anon]-.
M:    But you never got much for Christmas, I certainly didn’t. There were
      just no toys at all.
V:    Well you couldn’t- I think.
M:    [cough] in the forties [cough]
V:    The one thing I remember getting at Christmas was a very nice- and it
      was off a friend of my mum and dad’s.

I:    mm
M:    mm
V:    and a bit of fruit?
M:    mm
V:    Whatever- you know.
M:    That’s right and a few nuts. You alw- I had a pillowcase, always had
      a pillowcase and there was nuts in the bottom, a tangerine and an
      apple.
V:    mm, oh a tangerine. Yes.
M:    And erm they were- I don’t know that it was quite exciting to have
      those at the very bottom.
V:    Mm.
M:    But I used to be so upset when there was nothing left in it at all.
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
M:    And wishing there were more things, but there were no books Vivienne
      [anon]
V:    no
M:    and I never had a doll for- I never played with dolls.
V:    I- I wasn’t a doll person, I did have one and I didn’t like it.
M:    mm, well my mother-.
V:    I did have a nice doll’s pram.
M:    Yes.
V:    And bicycle that me granddad bought.
M:    vv
V:    But it wasn’t at Christmas, it was sort of later on.
TIME [19.00]
M:    Yes.
V:    When you could afford it.
M:    exactly. Yes, yes.
V:    You know cos they worked- worked hard.
M:    Well I do remember a book that I was bought. Two books- one was ‘The
      prisoner of Zenda’ and ‘Rupert of Hensor.’
V:    Oh I don’t remember that but I remember the first one.
M:    And they were hideous books, they were far too old for me.
V:    I was just thinking that. [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
M:    And I c- I don’t really think I ever read them really.
V:    No.
M:    but there were no children’s books. But [anon] from the post office,
      her parents could always find Rupert books.
V:    Could they?
M:    Mm, she always had the annuals for Rupert. And I was lucky, because
      she used to lend them to me.
V:    Yes, yes
M:    You know, and so I could read them. But I never had any books. And my
      mother, desperate to get me a doll she went to the doll’s hospital in
      Manchester.
V:    Oh I remember the doll’s hospital.
M:    And you remember that Vivienne [anon].
V:    Mm.
M:    Bought two heads and sewed them on this- these bodies she’d made.
V:    mm
TIME [20.00]
M:    And I had- I always had a black doll.
V:    mm
M:    I absolutely loved black dolls,
V:    mm
I:    mm
M:    more than white dolls. Cos I just had this attraction f- for black
      dolls. And she got me a black and a white one. And I went to see
      [anon] my friend at the time.
V:    She’s a mutual friend, [anon].
I:    oh, okay
M:    Yeah.
V:    We went to school with her, didn’t we?
M:    Yes, yeah. And [anon] dropped one of my dolls
V:    [gasp]
M:    and the head smashed into pieces.
I:    no
M:    And I was so horrified I lifted my arms up and dropped mine. So I had
      no dolls.
V:    [gasp] none at all
I:    [gasp]
M:    So both the heads had gone.
V:    Oh what a shame and your mum had gone to all that trouble.
M:    mm, yes, yes. Yeah, she w- she wasn’t- wasn’t particularly good at
      sewing. But erm, she went to quite a bit of trouble to try and make up
      for what wasn’t there.
V:    Something- What we couldn’t have.
M:    What we didn’t have, exactly.
V:    Yes.
M:    But my sister arriving in forty four. Everything went to her.
TIME [21.00]
M:    Er the- I- I could not remember what a banana looked like. I hadn’t
      ever had one, you see,
V:    mm
M:    that I could remember.
V:    I can’t remember when I was little, no. Because I was three in thirty
      nine. So when the bananas came, erm-.
M:    Now I don’t know how many there were, whether there was only one, but
      my father- it had to be [anon] that had the banana.
V:    mm
M:    I remember looking at this and thinking, ‘I wonder what it really
      does taste like?’
V:    really does taste like.
M:    And I didn’t find out, and I wonder why they did that in those days.
V:    They could’ve given you half each.
M:    Could’ve given us half each,
I:    mm
V:    yes
M:    yes they could actually. Erm so everything went to [anon]. Erm but it
      never affected me in any way.
V:    Never bothered you, no I mean-.
M:    I was never jealous.
V:    I was the first grandchild, spoilt. And then there was [anon] and
      then [anon] was the first grandson. And he was spoilt.
M:    mm, mm, mm
V:    But because I suppose my nanna and granddad- granddad in particular
      with [anon] I was- me nanna was for me.
TIME [22.00]
V:    Me mum and dad tried to make it up to [anon]. They gave her more.
M:    mm, yes, yeah.
V:    Like I went to the grammar school, [anon] went to the grammar school,
      so erm- made sure that [anon] went to [anon].
M:    Oh right, yes
V:    And got a city and guilds in erm-.
M:    yes, catering, wasn’t it?
V:    catering, yes.
M:    yes, yeah
V:    And then of course, [anon] and [anon]
M:    yes
V:    [anon] came along later on.
M:    Yes, a lot later.
V:    yes
M:    But my grandparents lived in [anon], as you know, and my grandmother
      would give my half brother half a crow, which was quite a bit of
      money.
V:    Ooh a lot of money in those days.
M:    And I was given sixpence.
I:    [laugh]
M:    I never had what he had. Because he was the son,
V:    son, mm
M:    you know, the grandson. And apparently my father used to get so upset
      about it and so annoyed, he’d take me home and give me half a crown.
V:    mm, crown as well.
I:    ahh, [inc]
M:    Yes. Just to make it up.
V:    mm, cos we used to joke, you know me mum made a lot of our clothes
      for [anon] and I.
TIME [23.00]
M:    Yes, yeah
V:    And of course we’d say- course our [anon]’s came from Kendal Mills
      [laugh]
M:    Yes, yeah. They were like that with sons.
V:    But erm- yes, yes.
M:    For some reason and we’ve got far more equality today.
V:    mm
M:    And you don’t treat your children any different at whatever age.
V:    No, me mum and dad didn’t really, erm.
M:    No.
V:    Erm, because er- we’ve got a photograph of the three of us and a
      friend of [anon] had knitted these fair-isle cardigans in two ply.
M:    mm, gosh.
V:    [anon] and I had cardigans, [anon] had erm- I think it was a v-neck
      sweater.
M:    mm, mm
V:    And me mum made sure that the three of us had the same.
M:    Yes. Yes, quality, mm, yeah.
V:    Yes, yeah. Tried to treat us all the same.
M:    mm
V:    But erm- now then, what (5.5) did I help out in the house a lot? Well
      I had to do.
TIME [24.00]
M:    yes I’m sure I did, I’m sure we had to really.
V:    Yes.
M:    Didn’t we?
V:    mm
M:    Erm washing up was always a pain, cos nobody wanted to dry.
I:    [laugh] no
V:    It’s strange nobody likes drying isn’t it?
M:    No, no, nobody wanted to dry. So we used to argue, the three of us,
      cos [anon] was too young.
V:    mm
M:    Erm and they used to- did they have no washing up liquid Vivienne
      [anon]?
V:    Oh I don’t remember washing up-.
M:    It was Persil.
V:    Persil, no washing up liq-
M:    We used to put washing powder in
I:    really
M:    and wash the pots in washing powder.
V:    I don’t remember washing up liquid.
M:    No.
V:    At all.
M:    Oh they didn’t have it, no, no, and my mother-.
V:    But when you think no washing up liquid, no washing machine, or
      things like that.
M:    No- no they boiled everything, didn’t they, in a boiler,
V:    mm
M:    but I do remember my mother grating fairy soap, white blocks- sorry
      green blocks of fairy soap.
V:    Green blocks of fairy soap.
M:    And she would grate it into the dolly tub.
V:    Yes.
M:    Er with boiling water so it melted,
V:    yeah
M:    an- and became-
TIME [25.00]
M:    so it would clean the clothes properly.
V:    mm, and then they-
M:    And they always washed on a Monday.
V:    And ironed on a tuesday.
M:    Yes, yes. If they got it dry.
V:    Yes, routine, routine
M:    mm, was routine. And we had a cellar, where my mother had clothes
      lines.
V:    We had cellars.
M:    And she used to hang her clothes
V:    mm
M:    in the cellar to dry. And we did have a very old coke burner down
      there for when the sirens went and there was bombing.
V:    Oh the sirens yes.
M:    yeah and- and erm, my grandfather had gone to the railways and he was
      a joiner, when he was younger and lived in the Lake District. But he
      came down to live with us and erm he went and got all these- erm, this-
       these pieces of wood from the railway that- sleepers.
V:    mm
M:    And he propped the whole of the ceiling of the cellar up in case we
      had an air-raid or a bomb-
TIME [26.00]
V:    yes we had our own sort of shelter at four-two-seven.
M:    yes
V:    At six-six-three you used to go down in the cellar.
M:    yes
V:    But erm I remember my nan, my nanna and [anon] heard the sirens. Went
      down into the cellar. [anon] came home from work to find them in the
      cellar. ‘What you doing in the cellar?’ ‘Well you know, the sirens
      went.’ They’d gone down for the all-clear, hadn’t they?
M:    oh
V:    [laugh] and they’d been there all morning.
M:    marvellous, oh.
V:    Oh dear.
M:    oh
V:    Little things like that stick in your mind, don’t they?
M:    Oh where were your- where are you parents from, well mine are from
      the Lake District. Both living in Windemere. Er back-to-back and never
      knew each other.
I:    [gasp]
V:    real-
M:    Because my father was four years older than my mother. But they
      didn’t find out until of course they met up, after his first wife
      died.
V:    mm
M:    And my- my mother was engaged to erm a- a man who went out to Canada
      and lost all his money on the crash-
TIME [27.00]
M:    Wall Street crash.
V:    crash.
M:    And said, ‘well I’ve got to start again, I’ll send for you,’
V:    mm
M:    and she said, ‘don’t bother I’m not waiting.’
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
M:    And meanwhile her best friend who was my father’s cousin, girl. Erm
      just asked her if she’d like to co- go out, as a foursome because
V:    mm
M:    my father had lost his wife
V:    yeah
M:    and she wanted to cheer him up and that’s how I become-
V:    mm
M:    th- that’s how I ended up sitting here talking today.
I:    [laugh].
V:    [laugh] yes
M:    If they’d never got together I wouldn’t be here.
V:    Well it’s true isn’t it?
M:    yes.
V:    You know.
M:    Yes oh life is strange isn’t it? Mm
V:    It is, because [anon] always wanted- he did his national service and
      always wanted to stay in the army.
M:    Oh did he?
V:    Yes he loved it. Absolutely loved it.
M:    Oh so why didn’t he?
V:    Because his mother and father said, ‘if you stay in the army, that’s
      it you’ve no mother and father.’
I:    [gasp]
TIME [28.00]
M:    You’re joking!
V:    No erm-.
M:    What was the reason?
V:    Because- well they thought it was erm a reflection on them that he
      wanted to be away from home.
M:    Oh.
V:    But they never really got on, he got on better with his father than
      his mother,
M:    mm
V:    but then his father would say, ‘well if you’d stayed in the forces,
      you would never have met Vivienne [anon].’
I:    mm
M:    mm
V:    And he said, ‘well I’m sure we would have done,’
M:    mm
V:    ‘because we were meant to be together.’
M:    mm
V:    So it’s funny how things work out, isn’t it?
M:    Yes. Yes, was he an only one?
V:    Oh yes.
M:    Oh [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
M:    oh yes.
V:    With a terrible mother.
I:    really?
M:    Really?
V:    Oh she was- [exhales].
M:    Possessive? Controlling?
V:    Yes and yet she was in a way possessive, and yet she hadn’t got a lot
      of time for him. So I could never weigh it all up. Nothing ever made
      sense.
M:    mm
TIME [29.00]
V:    Erm and his father was away a lot on business. You know and if he did
      anything wrong, ‘wait ‘til your father comes home!’
M:    mm
V:    And one incident, he’d been smoking when he was about ten or eleven,
      with a friend. Friend had a- parents had a pub and they went on the
      flat roof and he was so ill. And of course his mother, ‘wait ‘til your
      father comes home!’ and then when his father came home told him,
      ‘aren’t you going to give him a good hiding?’ So he said, ‘he’s learnt
      his lesson.’
M:    Mm.
I:    mm
M:    yeah
V:    And he never really smoked cigarettes again. Occasionally,
M:    mmhmm
V:    if [anon] lit up he’d say, ‘ooh I just fancy one,’ and he’d have one.
M:    mm
V:    But he never went out and bought a packet of cigarettes.
M:    Mm, my parents didn’t smoke. But my brother did, me half-brother did.
      And [anon] my half sister.
V:    mm, no me dad smoked but me mum couldn’t stand it.
M:    No, no.
V:    Couldn’t stand it. I’ve never smoked.
M:    No, no I haven’t.
V:    [anon] has smoked but gave it up some years ago.
M:    mmhmm
TIME [30.00]
V:    Erm [anon] has the odd one, more a social-
M:    mm
V:    doesn’t sit at home smoking.
M:    mm
V:    [anon] doesn’t smoke, [anon] doesn’t smoke.
M:    No.
V:    Erm-.
M:    mm, and actually my parents were tee-total.
V:    Were they?
M:    Until my father got to eighty and then he used to have his brandy in
      a morning, to keep his heart going he used to say.
V:    Well they used to say a drop of whiskey at night is good for you.
M:    Well yes, they did. Yes, yes, but erm
V:    That’s my excuse if I have one. [laugh]
M:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    It’s good for me!
M:    Oh but erm,
V:    cos you read all these things in the paper,
M:    yes, yes
V:    you know and glass of red wine.
M:    Well it’s beer today, apparently.
V:    I know that was in the paper the other day.
M:    Giving- yeah keeping your heart going.
V:    Don’t like beer.
M:    I think I’ll do without, mm, mm
V:    Don’t like beer at all. No.
M:    What are local people like? The people where I live- well they’re all
      very nice really, it’s quite quiet, but it’s a- it’s such a good area,
      I mean the house is up for sale, I can’t imagine why nobody buys it.
TIME [31.00]
I:    mm
M:    Because it’s such a super spot to be,
V:    mm
M:    you’ve got the railway, you’ve got-.
V:    mm, everything’s to hand isn’t it, yes
M:    Everything’s at hand, you’ve got sports centres, you’ve got swimming
      pools, golf courses.
V:    mm
M:    You can get into Manchester so quickly, and you can get onto the M-
      sixty- sixty two, sixty-one, fifty six, in ten minutes.
V:    mm, I think you’re better placed than I am, in Irlam,
M:    yes
V:    because the buses are about- they’re supposed to be every ten minutes
      but they’re not
M:    mm
V:    and there’s only really one into Manchester.
M:    mm
V:    And there’s another one that goes through Manchester into the
      Trafford centre, or the Trafford centre into Manchester. And they’re
      about the only two.
M:    Yes and the- the thing about the Trafford centre is- it- I didn’t
      like it when it was first built,
V:    mm
M:    I thought it would kill off all the sho- local shops, which it did.
V:    mm
M:    But I do enjoy going and I go at least twice a week.
V:    mm
M:    And I don’t particularly buy erm, but I c-
TIME [32.00]
M:    if I want to, everything’s there.
V:    You can, yeah, yeah
M:    I’ll just go because it’s very nice inside and you can have a nice
      coffee and a cake on a morning.
V:    In John Lewis, yes, mm
M:    Yes. And er- and I do quite enjoy going and it’s just so quick to get
      there and to park and-.
V:    It is, it’s no problem.
M:    It’s just no problem, so that’s a great advantage to this area to me.


I:    mm
V:    yes
M:    I’ve never been into Manchester for years and I don’t think I ever
      will really. I’ve got- There’s nothing there for me.
V:    Well I go into Manchester erm, normally every Thursday to meet two
      friends I used to work with many years ago at ICI.
M:    Oh right. Yes, yes
V:    And then I meet another friend every other week on a Wednesday,
M:    mm, right
V:    that I used to work with at ICI.
M:    mmhmm
V:    So [cough] but normally I park in Marks and Spencers and then on a
      Thursday have lunch in Marks, just a sandwich. One friend moans the
      whole of the time
M:    mm, mm
TIME [33.00]
V:    about the quality and the standard and the noise, cos it is noisy in
      Marks and Spencers.
I:    mm
M:    Oh right.
V:    Now if that particular friend doesn’t come, er [anon] and I will go
      to [anon],
M:    mm
V:    which is erm an Austrian patisserie.
M:    ooh
V:    Ooh you should see the cakes!
M:    Mm, very nice.
V:    Oh lovely. Erm then when I go with [anon] we go to the [anon]. Where
      you can have a three course lunch for six pounds fifty.
I:    ahh
M:    That’s good.
V:    Yeah.
M:    mm
V:    And I might walk through the Arndale centre
M:    mm
V:    erm, couple of times recently I have had a bit of a walk round the
      Arndale but I’ve been looking for specific shops.
M:    mm
V:    And (1.0) there everything seems that little bit bigger
I:    mm
V:    than in the Trafford centre.
M:    Trafford centre, yes.
V:    And on Sunday, [anon] and I and [anon] we’d taken [anon] back to w-
      erm the station, erm we went into (1.5)
TIME [34.00]
V:    the Arndale and I think- I can’t remember what we were looking for.
      But I was surprised, it was a Sunday and I was able to park in Marks
      and Spencers car park.
M:    Oh right.
V:    It’s not cheap, parking in-
I:    mm
V:    and it does add-
M:    mm
V:    it adds to me lunch when I go. I used to go on the bus.
M:    mm, yes.
V:    But you get on the bus and then there’s these girls that get on with
      their buggies,
M:    mm, mm
I:    mm
V:    dripping in cheap jewellery,
I:    [laugh]
V:    not a ring in sight, and oh. If smoking was allowed they’d be
      smoking.
M:    mm.
I:    mm
V:    I’m not a snob
I:    no
V:    but you know, you do have certain standards don’t you?
M:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    I think it’s the way we were brought up Maureen [anon], respect.
M:    Probably.
V:    In those days.
M:    Yeah. Yes probably.
V:    You respected your teachers and-
M:    mm
V:    and we went to church and Sunday school, didn’t we?
M:    Yes we did. We certainly did.
V:    And then the pictures after church on a Sunday night sometimes, the
      Palladium.
M:    Terribly naughty.
TIME [35.00]
V:    When you think about it.
M:    mm, yes we used to go on to the pictures after we’d been to church.
V:    mm. And we’d done our duty, hadn’t we?
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh] we’d been to church.
M:    Well, definitely! Yes those were the days.
V:    Happy days.
M:    But I think, I remember it being more difficult for food, clothes and
      everything else after nineteen forty five. Because that’s when it was
      really difficult, when they put bread on rationing. That was awful.
V:    Yes because rationing went on for quite some time, didn’t it?
M:    It went to about fifty two I think.
V:    Yes it went on for some time.
M:    But it went worse- I don’t think we probably got the help from
      America that we’d had during the war.
V:    Or thought we were going to get.
M:    Yes.
V:    That’s right.
M:    yeah I think so, mm.
V:    Because there was the air base in Warrington wasn’t there? Burtonwood
M:    Yes. The Americans, mm.
V:    erm and I know a friend of my auntie’s went out with one of the
      airmen
TIME [36.00]
M:    mm
V:    and er- he used to take to erm [anon], girlfriend, loads of sweets
      and things.
M:    Yeah.
I:    mm
V:    So you know we had sweets.
M:    Yes.
V:    in that way.
M:    Yes.
V:    But it was a long time before things were really back to normal.
M:    Anything like- well, above- above the counter.
V:    That’s right
M:    And on show, everything was under the counter.
V:    yeah.
M:    Nothing was on show. No food was on show.
V:    And I know we had a chicken nearly ever week and it was a friend of
      my granddad’s and me dad’s, used to get these live chickens
M:    mm
V:    and they were in Pendleton, and I had to go on the bus and bring back
      this chicken.
M:    Dead chicken, was it plucked?
V:    Alive Maureen [anon]!
M:    Oh you didn’t!
I:    [laugh]
V:    I did.
M:    [gasp]
V:    And I’d no choice, I had to do it.
M:    How did you carry it?
V:    It used to be in a bag, and
TIME [37.00]
V:    I’d be sitting on the bus, terrified in case it made a noise.
I:    [gasp] [laugh]
V:    Our [anon] would say that he did it, but if he did it, I don’t

      took anything that wasn’t his’.

      few of these veggies and brought them home.’
V:    Yeah, vegetables, mm
M:    But he never did. Never took anything that wasn’t theirs they were so
      honest.

M:    She’s a st- I think she’s a student now, I- I th- - I’m not sure

      do get them confused and they’re both at university, or one has

M:    Oh did she, I’ve no- I didn’t see that.
V:    Yeah and I’ve forgot- I’ve forgotten how long it took her,
M:    ooh

M:    The English Channel?
TIME [41.00]
V:    Hours and hours and hours.
M:    You’ve got the jellyfish problem with the English Channel.

M:    Oh gosh.
V:    No it was nice, watching the Lake District, yes
M:    Yes very beautiful if it’s not raining.
I:    [laugh]
V:    Ooh, the very first time we went on the Friday afternoon, it was
      raining so hard.
M:    mm
V:    ‘Oh what have we done, why have we come?’ But then Saturday and
      Sunday it was glorious.
M:    mm, mm, beautiful, mm
V:    Absolutely.
M:    Mm, they’ve had very bad weather this last winter.
V:    Mm with the snow and everything.
M:    Yes a lot of- yes, yeah and rain.
V:    I mean that’s why I can’t understand the reservoirs being so low.
M:    No but
V:    When we’ve had so much snow.
M:    My cousin, when she was telling me about these- this er grandson’s
      girlfriend. Erm she said, ‘oh you wouldn’t believe how low they are.’
      She said, ‘we’ve been out and we’ve been looking and they’re extremely
      low.’ mm
V:    I know when we used to drive over to Harrogate erm on the M-sixty-
      two, we always looked at one reservoir,
Time [42.00]
M:    mm
V:    ‘oh it’s a bit low this y- this week.’
I:    mm
V:    Do you know the one I mean?
I:    Yeah, yeah I go that way.
V:    Yes and er we’d be sort of, ‘oh there’s going to be a water
      shortage.’
M:    mm
I:    mm
M:    mm
V:    our [anon] had to defy the hosepipe ban before.
M:    He what, sorry?
V:    Had to defy the hosepipe ban. Because our [anon] got all dog’s poo on
      his shoes.
M:    oh, oh
V:    And so he had to swill them down.
M:    Did he? I hope this is not being used in evidence against him
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
M:    for a thousand pounds.
V:    I never thought about that [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    Oh dear.
M:    Confessions.
I:    [laugh]
V:    Confessions, yes.
M:    mm, well I mean, I use my hosepipe to fill my watering can and my gra-
       my son-in-law said, ‘you can’t do that it’s illegal.’ I said,
      ‘rubbish. It can’t be illegal.’ But I’ll tell you one thing. This
      hosepipe ban is so ridiculous cos you waste more money- sorry more
      water.
TIME [43.00]
V:    More water.
M:    In a watering can.
I:    yeah
V:    Well I think so, Maureen [anon] too.
M:    Because you’re being- it’s pouring out and
V:    yes
M:    and if it was coming out as a spray
V:    a spray
M:    and a shower, it would go into the flowers and everything quicker.
V:    Yes, yeah
M:    But it’s just going over the tops and- and going on the- one the
      road. On the pavements.
V:    I think it’s worse.
M:    mm
V:    I think it’s silly.
M:    Mm, I do. Yes, but still.
V:    I can understand them saying the hosepipe ban for washing cars at
      home.
M:    Well at home but what about these-
V:    but you can still-
M:    can you still take them to the-?
V:    Oh yes you can still take them to these places.
I:    yeah
M:    Places to have them cleaned. Oh right, right. I didn’t realise that.
V:    I mean the gardeners that I have, [anon] said that he’d looked it up
      on the erm internet
M:    mmhmm
V:    and it was so complicated, what you could, what you couldn’t do,
I:    [laugh]
M:    oh yes, yes,
V:    that in the end, he gave up.
M:    mm.
V:    United utilities saying one thing, somebody else saying something
      else, and he thought, ‘just don’t get it.’
TIME [44.00]
M:    mmhmm, mm, no. Well my- I’ve got one hanging basket, beautiful
V:    mm
M:    because it’s rained on it and the other one is slightly under the
      porch
V:    mm
M:    at the front door and it’s dead.
I:    ahh
M:    And [anon] never bothered watering it. So I’ve had to get it down and
      just let the tap run on it,
I:    mm
M:    so that’s wasted a lot of water.
V:    Yeah, yeah, yeah.
M:    Today, whether it will revive, I don’t think it will.
V:    mm, c- It will, it will cos they said to me on Tuesday, I said, ‘I
      know what you’re going to say,’ I said, ‘well you see it has rained so
      I thought to myself ‘I don’t need to water them,’
I:    mm
M:    ooh
V:    But you still need to water them, so-.
M:    Oh gosh you do because it doesn’t get through.
V:    no
M:    It only stays on the top.
V:    yes
M:    Hmm, how are we doing?
