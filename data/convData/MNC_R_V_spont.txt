      before like, [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    I hadn’t been with boys for like five years cos I went to an all
      girl’s school. Erm so it was just like really weird to go into a
      different environment of like a mixed school.
I:    mm

      [laugh] Have you ever moved house at all?

      erm, cos the new hou- for like- tw- like from twenty two and onwards
      they’d already been built, and the house we moved into was erm had

      around doing nothing
I:    [laugh]
R:    and Mum runs round after everybody [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    She always complains about it though no-one ever makes her do it. She
      always does it herself. It’s every Sunday, like when you’re finally-
      you know when you’re coming back from half-term and you’re going back
      to school on the Sunday she’s stressing out she’s like, ‘oh- oh have

      middle name [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh] Oh my god [laugh].
R:    [laugh] That’s how it goes. You’ve got some strange middle names

      lot now. But at the time it was just really good, it had really nice
      people there, everyone was really friendly.
R:    mm
V:    it like- the people there like were of all different types.
TIME [16.00]
V:    Like some were a lot rougher than others but when- like I didn’t
      really notice it at such a young age, like I was friends with anyone
      and everyone. And I still would be but I didn’t really notice it,
R:    mm
V:    but now when you walk past you can see the difference between
I:    yeah
V:    some of the kids and it is quite rough.
R:    Yeah I just hated our school cos th- you realise as you get older,
      kids just take the mick out of anything.
V:    Yeah [laugh]
R:    Like [laugh] everything it’s unreal. I remember one day, I w- went
      into school with a cold sore on my lip.
V:    Urgh.
R:    And I was like- yeah they’re horrible I know, but. And this guy’s
      going, ‘why’ve you got spaghetti Bolognese on you?’
V:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
R:    I’m like, ‘it’s- it’s in the morning, why would I be having spaghetti
      Bolognese in the morning? And it just doesn’t dry on my lip like
      that.’
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    I used to hate it [laugh]
I:    aww
V:    [laugh]
R:    But it was nice when everyone was obviously friendly and stuff but
      you don’t realise it when you’re a kid cos you’re so naïve at how
      stupid people were [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
I:    I know
R:    And how easy it is to get dragged into random social circles and
      stuff.
V:    mm
R:    Like I think I was lucky going to [dar] [anon] instead of [anon].
I:    yeah
V:    yeah.
TIME [17.00]
R:    Cos you see all the different- all the lads that went there it’s- I
      know they’re not- most of them are really nice but they’re just more
      prone to danger not- or not danger but trouble.
I:    yeah
R:    How was [anon]?
V:    [anon], what’s the question?
R:    How was it?
V:    It was good. [laugh] [inc]
R:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    there was quite a lot of bullying but like you kind of just got on
      with it, like [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    like, no matter where you go there’s always gonna be people who
      bully. But at the same time like you meet loads of good people there,
      and so long as you get in the right friendship group, then it was
      good.
R:    mm
V:    I went through about four, but [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
R:    [laugh] I think we were lucky with bullying at [anon].
V:    yeah
R:    It was always
V:    yeah, it’s-
R:    dead friendly and stuff and
I:    yeah
V:    Seem nice.
R:    You always thought the ha- they’re rough people when they didn’t hand
      their homework in [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    Not hitting teachers and stuff. ‘oh, you got a detention’ [laugh].
V:    [laugh] what is your best or funniest memory from when you were
      young?
R:    Erm I’m sure you’ve asked me this one before, but-.
V:    No what is your best memory?
R:    I’ll answer it again.
V:    Not your funniest.
TIME [18.00]
R:    My best memory. Erm I don’t know, not fr- I can’t remember much of my
      life, up until like, after year five [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    I can’t remember anything before that really. But erm- I- I know this
      is gonna make me sound sad but I remember when I was in year five and
      I got picked to play for the year six football team, and I was well
      happy [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
I:    ahh
R:    First person to do it through our school,
I:    ahh
R:    and I was chuffed with that. I just
V:    bless
R:    used to love football so, [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    what was yours?
V:    Erm best memory was probably like when we used to go camping in
      France, and erm, it was just like the whole experience. Like when we
      were driving down,
I:    yeah
V:    me and my dad u- well we all used to listen to like th- all the old
      school music and I used to sit in the front with my dad, to try and
      keep him- like to help him stay awake, and there was a time whenI
      don’t know cos I was asleep but I’d- I’d fallen asleep
I:    [laugh]
R:    [laugh]
V:    and songs were still playing but I was still singing with my dad,
      even though I was asleep.
I:    ahh
V:    And like we used to go canoeing a lot. And then erm it was like, you
      were going down in your canoe.
TIME [19.00]
V:    And there was a castle on one side, and you just think you’re going
      straight, and the next minute you realise the castle’s gone on the
      other side and it just used to feel like, proper magical. It was so
      good. But the only thing was, every time we used to go, we used to
      fight, with my sisters,
I:    oh
V:    like proper- get into proper screaming matches, like in this canoe
      [laugh] like
I:    [laugh]
R:    [laugh] Just throwing each other overboard.
V:    [laugh] literally we used to have so many water fights, and not the
      good kind.
R:    [laugh]
V:    And erm-.
R:    But with bad water [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh] no, but no you know like just like playful splash, but this
      was like, strangle splash [laugh]
R:    [laugh] trying to drown each other.
V:    But like it kind of just made it, like when we went a couple of years
      ago, like I couldn’t wait to go canoeing again, just to see if it- if
      it was the same, it was really good.
R:    Did you ever get hurt when you were fighting in the water?
V:    No. We did nearly er- not drown, but get into quite a bit of danger
      once, cos me and [anon] had been erm dec- we were in a canoe by
      ourselves,
I:    [laugh]
V:    so we decided to get out, cos it was hot, and just hold on to the
      canoe. But somehow we managed to lose the canoe.
R:    [laugh]
V:    So we were just floating in this river going downstream.
TIME [20.00]
V:    And like, there was rapids coming up. And then my dad had to like,
      swim over and like drag us to the side, and then we had to catch up
      with the other canoe, like later on in the stream.
R:    [laugh]
V:    It was pretty dramatic, but-.
R:    Rescue mission hopefully [laugh].
V:    [laugh]
R:    We never used to do anything like that. I think I remember for year
      seven birthday, went erm rock- abseiling with my uncle. We went
      tunnelling,
I:    ooh
R:    that was the only thing scary.
V:    I’d never do that.
R:    Tunnelling?
V:    Isn’t that where you go in like, little holes?
R:    Yeah it was pretty scary.
V:    No, no I couldn’t do that, claustrophobic.
R:    Although my brother- when we- when we went, [anon] came along with us
      and he was- dunno how old he was, he must’ve been about eight or
      something, he had his- you know those trainers you used to get with
      lights on, and we-
I:    oh yeah
R:    he kept hitting the bottom of his shoes so they lit up
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    for that split second. So we’d know we were okay.
V:    [laugh]
R:    But other than that it was good.
V:    Did you ever get her- hurt- did you ever get hurt whilst playing when
      you were a kid?
TIME [21.00]
R:    Yeah a few times, remember once when my dad’s- some guy my dad used
      to work with, his kid came round for the day and we used to have one
      of those plastic slides in the back.
V:    [laugh]
R:    And it used to feel so big when you were up there, but he’s a little
      kid who’s younger than me, and he pushed me over the edge
V:    [laugh]
R:    of the top of the slide and I broke my collar bone.
I:    oh my God
V:    Did you? Didn’t know that.
I:    ooh, [laugh]
R:    Yeah, sorry
I:    thanks
R:    [laugh]
V:    really?
R:    Yeah
V:    didn’t know that
R:    Yeah, and I was in hospital obviously, I was a crip [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
R:    for a few weeks
V:    What do you have to do if you break your collar bone, do you get like-
      ?
R:    It’s just a sling, you don’t- you’re not even in a cast, I think it’s
      just a arm sling.
I:    aww
R:    I can’t remember though and I remember when I was learning to ride
      the bike, I- I- and I can picture exactly where it is on the street as
      well, riding my bike I was going along and all of a sudden I just went-
       like fell on my side,
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    [laugh] and I don’t know why [laugh] and I hit- hit my head on the
      tree and it killed [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    And I remember playing in the back and I tripped over and I hit my
      side of me head on the little fence panel thing, the concrete fence
      panel on the side of that.
TIME [22.00]
V:    Aww.
R:    And my friend got sent home. [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    it’s like, ‘I think you’d best go home now, he’s hurt.’ He was like,
      ‘okay.’ I blamed it on him, so- [laugh].
V:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
R:    Did you ever used to have kids round your house when you were
      younger? At like primary school, for tea?
V:    Yes. My house was the house to be-
R:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    to be at, it was so good like, we always used to have like- like one
      night a week me [anon] and [anon] used to go for each- each other’s
      house for tea. And then erm we always used to have Halloween parties.
      Which used to like- I think I’d still be scared now
R:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh] like we- we had like the catflap that goes out to the outside
      of the house and my dad stuck his hand out like with the glove on and
      my dad just like when people were coming round, ‘I’ve lost my glove,
      if you notice it, like let me know. And like just bring it in to the
      house.’ And then we put erm, nuts or something down the side of the
      house, and it was all dark and we were walking down, and my mum was
      like, ‘oh these are the cockroaches, don’t worry about them.’
R:    [laugh] yeah
V:    And like, now it doesn’t sound scary but like it was and then erm
      someone went to go grab the glove.
TIME [23.00]
V:    And my dad grabbed her hand and literally I think it was [anon],
      cried.
R:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    It was so awful [laugh]. And then we had like a hole in the table and
      my dad’s head was un- like up through the hole but he had like a
      something covering it, so when you went to get your piece of cake or
      whatever was meant to be under there, and me Dad’d be like, ‘blar-
      aargh!’ [laugh]
R:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    with a mask on or something, it was really good.
R:    [laugh]
V:    So erm- we always used to have like birthday parties and have
      magicians and stuff over, it was good
R:    I remember my birthdays as a kid. Think- think the one I remember the
      most we had erm- erm what’s it called now? Bouncy castle in the back
      garden
I:    right
V:    oh yeah
R:    and it absolutely hammered it down that night.
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    And the guy was sat in his van for about three hours waiting for it
      to die down, he was just like this, ‘ahh’ [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    Everyone had gone home already and he was just there for about three
      hours after [laugh]
V:    aww
R:    Waiting for the weather to go, it was good. I used to love birth-
      kid’s birthday parties. You used to get so many random toys and stuff
      [laugh]
V:    And the party bags afterwards,
I:    yeah
R:    yeah, little bits of cake
V:    they were amazing. You used to always get like little whistles and
      stuff and-.
TIME [24.00]

R:    I remember we used to go [anon] and for dessert we always used to get
      erm vanilla and strawberry cake- no not cake erm, ice cream [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
R:    and with erm jelly as well, oh it was horrible [laugh] but it was so
      good as a kid, so much sugar at once [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    did you not have any parties like that?
V:    No [laugh]
R:    I remem- remember once when JJB first opened and you know they had a
      little play area there?
I:    Yeah
V:    oh yeah.
R:    And they had the- the one half of a football pitch and someone had-
      er someone invited me to their party there, said they were having it
      at JJB. So I was saying to Mum, ‘oh, it’ll be a football party.’ So I
      had my- had my whole football kit on, my shin pads and everything. I
      went there, we were in the bloody play area, [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    I looked like I’d been padded up for war [laugh] rather than for
      playing tig in the play area.
V:    [laugh]
R:    I was running round with my shin pads on and stuff [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
R:    I was safety proofed.
TIME [25.00]
V:    Was that, was it alphabet zoo?
R:    oh, in Sale
V:    The one that used to have the big blue slide. That was like nearly-
      well felt vertical I don’t know if it was.
R:    Yeah.
V:    Oh it was amazing and there was erm-.
R:    You had to get in those sacks didn’t you?
V:    Yeah.
R:    to go in it
V:    It was so good and you used to have those big like- what are those
      like cylinders and you had to squeeze through the two of them?
R:    Oh yeah.
V:    And then they used to have one where you used to have to go through
      like four but kids used to get stuck in there,
I:    [laugh]
R:    [laugh]
V:    so they had to close it down, like that area. Because like ch-
R:    did they?
V:    yeah kids were getting stuck in there.
R:    I remember when-
V:    I was always so scared to go through them.
R:    I had a birthday party there and you used to- you always used to sit
      on there. And we’ve got a video at home and I had a stiff neck. Oh my
      gosh!
V:    [inc] [laugh]
R:    no, I couldn’t move, I was at the end of the table like, ‘urgh!’
V:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
R:    trying to blow my candles out like ‘[noise]’ not moving my neck at
      all [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh] that’s so funny
R:    But when- when they did that they- they did erm- used to play party
      games up there as well.
I:    mm
V:    yeah
R:    And seeing myself dancing as a kid, oh my god it must’ve been so
      embarrassing. Like, ‘that’s not my kid there!’ [laugh]
I:    [laugh]

R:    And they used to get the inflatable slide out for you as well, when
      we’d all finished and stuff
TIME [26.00]
I:    yeah
V:    Yeah so when you finished the party and went down the slide.

I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    Food coming up. I used to- I don’t think I ever went down that blue
      slide. Think I was too scared. I think I might’ve b- I think I
      might’ve been once.
V:    I loved it.
R:    It’s like a vertical drop! [laugh] break my neck or something
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh] it was amazing and you went to the ball pool at the bottom.
R:    Yeah.
V:    and do you remember the massive ball pool and you could like hide
      underneath.
R:    Yeah, and then get stood on.
V:    It was so good. Yeah [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
R:    [laugh]
V:    Oh that’s a risk you’ve got to take when you’re playing hide and
      seek.
R:    I used to love that I absolutely used to love it.
V:    We should go.
R:    I- I miss being a- it’s closed down [laugh]
V:    Aww [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
R:    Yeah, I miss being a kid when you’re- you see some stuff and you’re
      just like- and you see like your toys now and you’re like, ‘how did I
      play with them for so long?’ [laugh]
V:    Yeah like Barbies, like, Oh well maybe not you, but maybe like Ken or
      something or action man.
R:    well [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    But like literally you’d play for hours. And what do you do with just
      a doll?
I:    yeah

I:    [laugh]
R:    and I remember when I thought, ‘right I’m going into secondary school
      now’
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    [laugh] ‘I need to get rid of it.’ [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    And I remember it used to take me about an hour to get to sleep
      without it.
V:    aww.
I:    aww
R:    but it was horrible, I know [laugh]
V:    [laugh] bless

R:    Oh my god he was so annoying he was so patronising.
V:    What did he teach?
R:    Chemistry, it was- oh he used to froth at the side of the mouth
      [laugh] and everything
V:    ooh.
R:    he looks like a rat [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    Like he was really nice if you wanted to do well but I remember in A-
      level chemistry, he just annoyed me. And he was so patronising. Cos I
      couldn’t do it, I got into A-level and I thought, ‘yeah I got an A at-
      in science in gcse.’
TIME [28.00]
R:    then you go into chem.- chemistry doing A-level like going, ‘wait a
      minute I don’t actually know anything about science.’ [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    I used to absolutely hate him. What’s yours?
V:    Erm I’ve always got on with all my teachers, I was a goody two shoes
      [laugh] but I remember in erm [anon] not [anon] erm [anon] there was
      this really like chubby lady teacher that er had really dark, curly
      hair. And erm she was always screaming at all the kids. And you’d hear
      her like three rooms down. So you were always
R:    [anon] [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh] you were always really scared, like to speak to her. And one
      day I had to go and like tell her something, I was like sent from
      class to go tell her. And I was like stood behind her waiting for her
      to finish talking, but she started walking backwards [laugh] and she
      fell on top of me.
I:    [laugh]
V:    And I was literally like tiny
R:    [laugh]
V:    when I was little and I was just laid underneath her and this massive
      woman was like on top of me. But she couldn’t get up [laugh]
TIME [29.00]
V:    And people had to help her up and I just thought like, ‘I could never
      live this down,’
I:    [laugh]
R:    [laugh]
V:    I wouldn’t ever speak to her again [laugh] she was so scary. Can you
      imagine it though, like this massive woman like tipping over on top of
      you?
R:    Just like a turtle, not being able to get up [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    it’s like, ‘[noise]’. Did you ever used to do show and tell at
      school, like
V:    Er yeah we always used to. Erm I don’t remember what I brought, I
      used to love it though.
R:    I think I w- in year six I remember bringing in my hamster

V:    [laugh]
R:    [laugh] [inc] [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    but, no I used to- and it was so strange cos everyone picked like-
      brought in these interesting animals, and I brought in a bloody
      hamster [laugh]
I:    aww
V:    aww
R:    The only interesting story was it tried to escape once [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    The most boring pet life ever [laugh]
I:    aww
V:    [laugh] You were only ever allowed that, weren’t you? You’ve not had
      anything else, pet wise?
R:    I’ve had a couple of goldfish from school fairs and stuff [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh] Nice!
R:    I used to love our school fairs. They were really good.
TIME [30.00]
V:    were they?
R:    You used to have your little, erm, your sponge to throw at your
      teachers and stuff.
I:    yeah
V:    did you?
R:    Yeah did you not have that?
V:    no.
R:    Oh you were from [anon], they were probably throwing rocks at
      teachers [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    Yeah but when you were a kid, no-one could hit the teachers so it was
      a pretty safe bet of doing it, wasn’t it?
V:    sure
R:    And sports day as well.
V:    I loved sports day.
R:    and I remember the sports day that we had in [anon], we used to have
      osprey, eagle, hawk and kestrel little team- teams that you were in.
V:    How do you remember?

R:    Even at secondary school?
V:    Even at secondary school. Ev- everyone got like- you know like you
      used to get class detentions, for everybody speaking? They always used
      to like pull me up at the end and say, ‘don’t bother coming back for
      the detention at the end of the day.’ I was like, ‘yes!’ [laugh]
R:    [laugh] Bet everyone hated you [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    they did

I:    [laugh]
R:    [laugh]
V:    and then er at primary school, whenever anyone used to get in trouble
      and like need an alibi, erm, they always used to come to me and say,
      ‘tell them that I didn’t do this,’
R:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    ‘tell them I was somewhere else.’ And I would be like- cos I was
      always cool with the boys
R:    [laugh]

R:    [laugh]
V:    And erm he came up to me and he was like, ‘Veronica [anon] I’m going
      to get expelled you have to like, lie for me.’ And I was like, ‘oh no
      but you’re a boy so okay.’ [laugh]
R:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    And I was like, ‘no he was here with me we were reading.’ And then
      like, they completely believed me and then the teacher- well the
      dinner lady got in trouble.
R:    Got sacked yeah [laugh] lying
V:    she did for ma- for making like allegations, but she was a horrible
      dinner lady anyway. That was like the worst thing I ever did.
R:    I remember our dinner ladies we used to- there always used to be like
      the ty- the stereotypical nasty one that they were always scared of

R:    And have your dinner but when you were in like reception to year two
      you had to wait ‘til half past
V:    aww
R:    before you could go out. And we used to have to just draw in these
      books and it was so boring. It was unreal [laugh]
I:    [laugh]

V:    Not really interesting or good, it’s just-.
TIME [36.00]

      the shrapnel like went all in her skin and stuff. But she was okay,
      survived, rah, rah, rah, but my granddad had a massive hole in his
      neck and he told us all that erm, he’d been shot in the neck in the
      war.
R:    [laugh]
V:    Erm told my mum, mum believed it for fifteen, twenty odd years.
      However long it was and we believed it up un- like, up until a couple
      of years ago. And he it just came out one day, saying like he didn’t
      really get shot and had an operation.
I:    [laugh]
R:    [laugh]
V:    I was like, ‘how can you tell us our entire lives that you’d got shot
      and made us think like you’re some hero,’

V:    and he just wasn’t. [laugh]
I:    [laugh]

V:    but like you wouldn’t really doubt it if you’d been told-.
R:    Did your dad know that it wasn’t real?
V:    Er I don’t know, maybe.
R:    My- my parents never used to play tr- tricks on me. I just used to
      cry if they did [laugh].

      escalators cos they were flat I was like, ‘yay!’ [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    But now you see them at asda and they’re just annoying [laugh]

I:    yeah
R:    Where else have you been on holiday then, is it just France and

      pancakes, scrambled eggs,  bit of crispy bacon, syrup, and like you
      think , ‘how disgusting does that sound?’ It’s not.
R:    [laugh]
V:    They must put something in there just to make you think it’s nice
I:    [laugh]
R:    [laugh]
V:    but it’s really nice and the burgers. Like when me and mum used to go
      when we- when I was younger, to visit her brother, erm we just used to
      have to share a meal because
I:    yeah
V:    I couldn’t physically eat one and it was a waste of money and mum
      would never eat it all so we always used to have to share, but erm
R:    [laugh] super large portion.
V:    We used to go to this place called er the Crab Bucket, or something,
      and you used to just get like a massive bucket of unlimited crab
      claws.
I:    oh God
V:    And that was amazing.
R:    Oh it sounds it yeah [laugh]
V:    It was really nice.

R:    They have crab claws we’ve got Kentucky fried chicken [laugh]
V:    No it was really good, what about you?
R:    Erm when I was younger I used to go to Majorca a couple of times but
      then we gave up on that side of things [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
TIME [39.00]
R:    And got the caravan [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
R:    And then we used to go to Dorset and Cornwall and remember the trips
      to Cornwall, were over like thirteen hours, just stuck in traffic
      constantly [laugh]
I:    mm
V:    Really?
R:    That’s when dad decided to invest in some erm DVD players for the
      back seats
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    so we wouldn’t get too bored.
V:    aww
R:    Then he used to shout at us telling us to ‘turn it down, it’s
      distracting him while his driving’
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    And the classic, ‘if you don’t shut up I’ll turn round!’ [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh] Fifteen hours in.
R:    and then- and then later on we’ve ventured to France and that’s when
      I got too tall for the caravan and got kicked outside into a tent.
I:    Oh no [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    On my own. That was the last straw I think I was like, ‘I’m not going
      back.’ And then later on we went to- back to Spain I think, for the
      last- Oh we went to [anon] as well in Lanzarote.
I:    mm
R:    Like a sports complex.
V:    Could not have a hot summer holiday like that though.
R:    No it wasn’t a summer holiday it was in April though, was in like
      April, March for Easter holiday.
V:    Yeah but th- wasn’t that your main holiday?
R:    No I don’t think so.
V:    I’m sure it was
R:    Probably went caravanning after it. [laugh]
TIME [40.00]
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh] Caravans.
R:    No I used to be sca- I used to hate like flying though.

R:    I went round my auntie and uncle when they took erm her daughter-
      their daughter and her husband and they were filming her when my
      auntie, when she was taking off.
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    Oh my god she looked like she was having a panic attack, like, white
      knuckle ride gripping onto the- onto the side
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh] ‘no’
R:    Just like head straight back into the seat and it was like, ‘please
      don’t take off, please don’t take off!’ it was so funny [laugh] but
      it’s just weird it runs in the family stuff like that. Like I won’t- I
      won’t go on rollercoasters.
I:    mm
V:    That’s cos of your mum.
R:    Unless- unless there’s peer pressure on me [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    l- if- peer pressure’s the worst thing, like when we went camping, I
      wouldn’t have gone into the lake if no-one else did.
I:    Really?
TIME [41.00]
R:    Mm, it was freezing [laugh].
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh] Yeah, I was really tempted to go in but I didn’t get enough
      peer pressure.
R:    I get- I- I always get scared of like erm when I’m swimming in the
      sea, even when-
V:    crabs?
R:    no when it’s quite deep, like- I dunno I just like picture getting
      dragged down by something [laugh]
I:    yeah, mm
V:    Like a shark or something.
R:    Yeah. Even though I know it wouldn’t happen.
V:    I don’t like being out of my depths in the sea.
R:    But I don’t know why, it’s scary, when I can’t see the bottom it’s-
V:    yeah
R:    freaks me out.
I:    yeah
R:    Like I used to be scared when we used to go on the ferries to France,
      like if it crashed, and I was always thinking, ‘well you’d die
      wouldn’t you? You wouldn’t be able to get out.’
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh] aww
R:    I was scared.
V:    very negative.
R:    It is.
V:    [laugh]
R:    It’s me mum that [laugh]
V:    yeah
I:    aww
V:    And like if you go to like Greece or somewhere, like the- the sea’s
      proper crystal clear, and you can see everything. So it’s no too bad,
      c-
I:    yeah
R:    I remember when we went to Bulgaria with the lads, the sea there was
      horrible. Like it was really hot
I:    mm
R:    but it was just filled with jellyfish and rubbish and-
I:    eurgh
V:    eurgh
R:    you couldn’t really go in it.

      a kid and stuff and like-.
R:    I didn’t.

V:    [laugh]
R:    I was just gonna carry on the conversation but ask me a question,
      it’s okay.

V:    [laugh]
R:    I’ll answer it [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
R:    Do you want me to ask- ask you a question? Erm (3.0).
TIME [43.00]
R:    There’s- I- I w- I’m just gonna carry on with my conversation
V:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
R:    [laugh] Like I hate how my mum and dad used to- well my mum
      especially used to
I:    ooh
R:    make me scared of like, loads of random things. Like rollercoasters
      and-
I:    mm
R:    sh- cos she was always like, ‘don’t go near the edge you might die!’
      [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
R:    And when you’re a kid you’re like, ‘will I?’ [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
R:    And it kind of sticks with you, doesn’t it, and like
I:    yeah
V:    yeah

R:    [laugh] Oh I love animals, they just don’t seem to love me. [laugh].
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh] No er it’s completely different like, in my family. Like-
      like, my mum was always scared but my dad was always erm encouraging
      me. Like to go on rollercoasters and
R:    mm
V:    like proper like, ‘seek the thrill’
R:    [laugh]
V:    Which I still do now.
R:    like I remember when we went to ‘Go Ape’ in- first time we went to
      France. I did the first one. But I remember getting stuck on like-
      there’s like a skateboard
V:    aww [laugh]
R:    and you have to attach yourself to the top of it. And you got to make
      sure your karabiners are the right way round. And I attached one of
      them the wrong way.
TIME [44.00]
R:    And I was sliding down and li- I got like a quarter of the way across
      on this skateboard
I:    [laugh]
R:    that was really loose,
V:    [laugh]
R:    I was holding on for dear life. And I realised I couldn’t go any
      further cos one of my karabiners was stuck round the other pieces of
      wire,
I:    [laugh]
V:    [laugh]
R:    and I was like, ‘no!’ Like felt like I was gonna die up there [laugh]
      So I had to drag myself back and unhook myself. And I think I was
      scared form then on.
V:    Yeah. Like I dragged you ‘go ape’ the other- like
R:    yeah
V:    couple of months ago didn’t I?
R:    Yeah.
V:    Was it that scary then?
R:    Yeah it was pretty scary [laugh]
V:    [laugh]

V:    [laugh] traumatised.
R:    I’m not a big fan of heights [laugh]
V:    You’re not a big fan of anything.

I:    [laugh]
V:    You’re like, attached.
R:    I know I am, but, no like when you took me it was- it’s one of those
      things where you don’t want to do it but then, when you’ve done it
      you’re like ‘yeah, let’s do it again, let’s do it again, let’s do it
      again!’ [laugh]
V:    Yeah, I love those things.
R:    But when you’re up there you’re like, ‘no no please don’t!’ [laugh]

R:    I- in France we met this erm- Mum and dad met this couple, and they
      had two kids of a similar age to me and [anon] and erm we went with
      them to go ape. And it was the one- the time when I got stuck on the
      skateboard. And this guy’s dad had to get erm abseiled down by the
      people cos he was scared.
V:    Why?
R:    He couldn’t do it he was scared of heights.
V:    How embarrassing.
R:    And his little ten year old kid did it and he was- he was like
      hugging this tree, waiting for the people to climb up and-.
V:    Aww. The man or the ten year old?
R:    The man.
V:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
R     It was kind of like, ‘see dad? I’m not a girl.’ [laugh]
I:    aww
V:    [laugh] aww bless.
R:    And he had to wait there for like half an hour while they got all the
      equipment sorted up and stuff, and get carried down.
I:    aww
V:    Aww I couldn’t do that, I’d rather just finish than have the shame of
      s- of another full grown man carrying-.
R:    E- everyone watching you, ‘ha ha!’
V:    Exactly cos you’re keeping everyone else like up, cos you can’t like

V:    [laugh]
R:    You g- just go to think like- I don’t think- you just gotta- it’s
      weird, the connotation of when you are- as a kid. How much it stays
