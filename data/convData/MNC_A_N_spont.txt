      shepherds pie’

A:    she goes, ‘well, we can’t do child’s portions of the shepherds pie’
      she’s like, ‘why?’, ‘they’re already portioned up in an adults
      portion, and they’re that price, and it doesn’t say anywhere that we
      can do a child’s portion’ and she’s like, ‘well, we want child’s
