H:    [inc]
S:    [inc]
H:    no, no, you’re right (0.5)
I:    it’s a good job I checked that
H:    yeah
I:    oki doki, so can you just- just talk for a couple of seconds normally
just so I can
H:    yeah
I:    just hear-
H:    my name is Harriet Rickman [anon]
I:    [laugh]
H:    and I am absolutely fantastic
I:    great (1.5) what about you?
S:    Harriet [anon] speaks for the rest of the family with [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
H:    [laugh]
I:    right, that’s fine I think
H:    yeah
I:    erm, take it away [laugh]
H:    right, so what I was saying before is, years ago, when kids where in
      the street if they were cheeky or anything like that
S:    mm
H:    you give them a clip round the ear
I:    [laugh]
H:    and if they went running in saying to their Mum, ‘Mum, Mum, Mrs such-
      and-such-a-body’, or, ‘Aunty Doree’s just hit me’ her answer would be,
      ‘well, you must’ve deserved it’
S:    yeah
H:    and it was right, whereas now, a kid in the street, the other week it
      was, erm, he stood right in front of me and he wouldn’t let me pass
TIME [01.00]
H:    so, I got his arms like that and I moved him to one side
S:    yeah
H:    and-
S:    where was this, in yours?
H:    it- yeah, on- on [anon]
S:    right
H:    and he goes, ‘you’re not allowed to touch me, I’m going to get the
      police’, so that’s what you get now
S:    yeah
H:    whereas years ago, cos you knew you was gonna get a clip round the
      ear
S:    you didn’t do it
H:    you didn’t do it
S:    or you chose who you did it to
H:    yeah, now-
S:    yeah
H:    it- it’s a different story, and like I say, you were always in your
      own street
S:    yeah
H:    all- a lot of the doors were open, kids were playing, I remember
      [anon]
S:    mm
H:    you know, the door was open, he was in and out, and all the kids were
      in the street
S:    yeah
H:    you never sorta moved out your area
S:    no
H:    whereas now, they do move out the area, they do wander all over the
      place, and they’re in gangs
S:    you see th- I think the thing is though aswell like I- the-
      culturally, we’ve changed so much, like, in them days
TIME [02.00]
S:    forty, fifty years ago, you stayed with- from- from where you was
      born (0.5) you went to school, you got married, and you moved into the
      same area
H:    yeah
S:    near your Mam
H:    yeah
S:    and that’s- that’s what happened, whereas nowadays, you know, we- w-
      we finished school, and, you know, I come from Salford, but I might
      get a job, say, in Warrington, or Cheshire, or (0.5) well, anywhere,
      because we’re a lot more mobile, we’ve got cars, trains, and I- y-
      which you didn’t have in them days
H:    yeah, so you’d move out your area and a lotta p- like you say, a
      lotta people are moving so the community is gone
S:    yeah
H:    people don’t know everybody like they used to
S:    no
H:    do you know
S:    yeah
H:    the- the know them there, them there, you know, and now, that’s gone,
      some people don’t even see their neighbours,
S:    yeah, a- or acknowledge them
H:    for days
S:    yeah,
H:    on end
S:    I’ve got a lad near-
H:    do you know
S:    I- you know, it’s very rare I mean I’ll- I’ll let onto them
      neighbours there, but they never speak to anybody
H:    no
S:    erm, (0.5) and- but
TIME [03.00]
S:    what I’m thinking is, if you move away, so, say you move to
      Warrington from- from Manchester when you’re bringing your own
      children up, you don’t know your neighbours, so you wouldn’t allow
      your children to play in the street would you
H:    t- sp- no, no, th- that’s another thing, a lotta kids now, at one s-
      that’s- I mean [anon] said to me the other day,
S:    yeah
H:    ‘put the baby at the door’, he says, ‘I took him for a- took him for
      a walk’
S:    yeah
H:    ‘and I parked him outside the door’, he says, ‘now how often do you
      see a child parked outside the door getting some fresh-’ you never,
      but at one time babies were- you had a baby and, ‘ooh, look, they’ve
      had a new baby’ cos it’d be outside the front door
S:    yeah
H:    in a morning, washed, fed, time for a nap, in the pram and outside in
      the air, you never see that now
S:    no
H:    they never put a baby at the front door, cos you’re too scared
      someone’s gonna come along
S:    yeah
H:    and snatch it
S:    yeah, yeah, it’s horrible that really isn’t it
H:    it, yeah
S:    cause that’s I mean-
H:    yeah
S:    that-
TIME [04.00]
S:    I think that’s one- the one where you do get talking to people, is,
      because, you know, y- you’ll be talking about, ‘ooh, is that you’re
      dog’, or ‘is that- ohh, is- is that your little’n’ and that’s how you
      get communities building up, so it- it- it’s hard now isn’t it, I mean
      if you’re working full time,
H:    yep
S:    so the kids are being dropped off at a childminder’s, when do you get
      time to mix
H:    that’s it, but that’s another thing you see, I’d say ninety percent
      of the mothers work now
S:    yeah, yeah
H:    whereas they didn’t then
S:    yeah
H:    nobody worked then so, mothers were at home all day
S:    mm
H:    they could socialise with the neighbours, and get to know the
      neighbours, whereas now, you’re up in the morning, children at
      babyminders, out at work, pick the kids up after work, back home,
      doing the tea, you’re too knackered to do anything else,
S:    no
H:    to go socialising, most of the time it’s- it’s
S:    mm
H:    weekends, and then it’s people you already know
S:    yeah, yeah
H:    so you don’t get- y- you lose- you losing a lot of the community, not
      just
TIME [05.00]
H:    (0.5) well, (0.5) like I say, women having to go out to work
S:    mm
H:    because they can’t afford to survive on the one wage
S:    yeah
H:    but that’s as well, because we’ve got very materialistic, cos at one
      time
S:    mm
H:    if you didn’t have a telly, you didn’t have a telly
S:    yeah
H:    it didn’t matter
S:    yeah
H:    but now everybody wants, ‘ooh, the Joneses have got this, so’
S:    mm
H:    ‘we want one’
S:    mm
H:    so, to get these things you’ve and- and in getting them things I
      think you’re sacrificing (0.5) the community part of it
S:    yeah
H:    you know, there’s that little network is dwindling, but everyone’s
      becoming more materialistic, they’ve got the video, they’ve got the
      computer, the children have got all the best trainers, and this, that
      and the other
S:    two cars on the drive, yeah
H:    yeah, so
S:    mm
H:    you’re g- you’re gaining material things-
S:    in one way, yeah
H:    here,
S:    yeah
H:    but you’re losing some of the values in the home, and the social
S:    yeah
TIME [06.00]
H:    think, on that side
S:    I absolutely agree with you w- on that, and I think from my
      perspective, you know, when m- me Mum left school, her views on life,
      were, you know, get married to a lovely fella, have children, build-
      build a home
H:    yeah
S:    you know, she- she went to, erm, to college to do secretarial, erm,
      work as a stop gap, until what she wanted was to get married, and have
      children-
H:    wanted to get married, but-
S:    when I was leaving school, the last thing on earth I wanted to do was
      get married and have children,
H:    children
S:    to me that was a put down
H:    yeah
S:    my- from my perspective, it was, no, get out in the workforce, you’re
      getting the best job you can, you’re earning your own money, you know,
      your own wheels, independent
H:    ‘dent
S:    so I mean, in- in that short space of time and-
H:    of time
S:    time and you’re only talking, well me Mum was twenty-one when she had
      me and [anon] so it’s only, pff, eighteen, twenty years
H:    years, yeah
S:    for a complete turn around
H:    turn around, yeah
S:    but now I think women are realising
TIME [07.00]
S:    in- in, you know, in this day in age, that we’ve lost out somewhere,
      you know, we’ve made a rod for our own back, not only are we, you
      know, bringing up families, running a household, you know, keeping a
      relationship together, hopefully, if you do, but we’re also working
      full time [laugh]
H:    I know, it’s funny because did you see it on the telly, that they
      said, although women have got more rights, erm, more independence than
      this, that and the other (0.5) they are less happy, th- erm, ninety
      percent of them are less happy than they were fifty years ago
S:    yeah, yeah,
H:    you know, th- they-
S:    I can really believe that
H:    really not content at all
S:    mm
H:    they said and I- I- I think it was Loose Women I was watching and th-
      they were saying
S:    oh yeah
H:    I love them, and they were saying it’s because, this professor says
      it’s because, women have too high expectations of love
TIME [08.00]
H:    and romance and what they expect
S:    right, right
H:    and one of them said, it’s not that they have too high a
      expectations, it’s that they won’t settle for anything less
S:    right
H:    whereas at one time, if you got married, you stayed because of the
      children
S:    right
H:    and you put up with abuse, and you put up with drinking, and you put
      up with all sorts, because
S:    yeah, yeah
H:    that was the norm, it was a big shame at one time to get divorced,
S:    mm
H:    or leave
S:    yeah
H:    the- the- you know, separate
S:    yeah,
H:    whereas now-
S:    cause I think it was always the woman who was to blame, no matter
      what went on
H:    on, yeah, yeah
S:    you know, socially, it was always the woman who was to blame you
      know, she couldn’t keep her marriage together, she couldn’t do this
H:    yeah
S:    she’s the one with the problem, whereas th- I mean that must’ve been
      the shame that people had to carry if they decided to leave a
      relationship then
H:    yeah, I- I couldn’t imagine
S:    mm
H:    having to stay in a relationship that I wasn’t happy in, no way
S:    no, no
H:    I just couldn’t, I d- I- I wonder how these women coped
S:    I think
TIME [09.00]
S:    do you know, I’ve thought about this, and I honest- honestly think
      that because (0.5) women didn’t have a choice in them days, erm, and
      perhaps I’m- might be talking a hundred years ago when divorce wasn’t
      on the cards, erm, but you know, I know people from other cultures
      from- from cultures which are very similar, erm, Ni- Nigerian culture,
      (0.5) if they- they’re not happy in a marriage, they haven’t got a
      choice, they have to stay at it, and I think if you think about it,
      that makes you work harder at it, if you haven’t got a choice, if
      you’re stuck with this bugger for the next seventy years, you aint
      gotta choice, you’ll work at making the relationship work for you
      because you don’t have a choice, and perhaps now we’re- we’re just,
      perhaps we’re thinking, ‘oh no, forget that, farts in bed, that’s it,
      gone, next one’
H:    it’s too easy for us, yeah, too easy for us to change, I suppose
      there’s certain things in that that you could say, yeah
TIME [10.00]
H:    (0.5) but there’s the extremes where you get
S:    mm
H:    really horrible men that
S:    right
H:    are abusive and stuff
S:    yeah
H:    women died because they couldn’t leave they’d,
S:    yeah, yeah
H:    you know, g- get beat up and summet could happen whereas, mind you,
      even now today (0.5) you will see that a battered wife (0.5) ninety
      percent of them stay with the husband
S:    yeah
H:    they don’t always report it, they cover it up, they, you know
S:    mm
H:    because they say it’s a syndrome don’t they,
S:    yeah
H:    once you get in that situation, it’s very, very hard
S:    mm, yeah
H:    to get out
S:    and I- I think- I think that- that’s t- very true, that is- that is
      very true, but- and I think that’s- the- a battered wife syndrome is
      different from an unhappy marriage, or- or a marriage that isn’t-
H:    yeah
S:    or, a relationship that isn’t as fulfilling as you would want it to
      be
H:    yeah, it’s not got the spark- what- what you perceive as love and the
      excitement and the butterflies in your stomach
TIME [11.00]
H:    I don’t care who gets that
S:    yeah, yeah
H:    after twelve month that goes doesn’t it
S:    course it does
H:    and it does end up the norm,
S:    yeah
H:    you know, just
S:    yeah
H:    like a routine, ‘morning, love, right, off to work, see you later,
      what do you want for tea’
S:    but in some ways I think that’s really nice and that’s, you know,
      that’s one of the things I miss about being in a long term
      relationship, perhaps the mundane-cy of it, but, there’s somebody
      there who says,
H:    yeah
S:    ‘do you want a brew love’, or,
H:    I’d- I- I know what you mean, and I agree with you, that’s nice, but
      that’s where
S:    the rot sets in
H:    a problem can start, because when you’re both going out to work,
      you’re both meeting new people, and then someone pays you attention,
      and there’s a bit of excitement there, that’s when
S:    mm, mm
H:    that hum drum life all of a sudden becomes, ‘I don’t know if I can
      put up with that’, you know,
S:    yeah
H:    do you know what I mean because
S:    mm
H:    there’s a bit of excitement over there and I think, even in (0.5) a-
      a marriage where it’s hum-drum like that
TIME [12.00]
H:    you still need a bit of excitement in some way or another
S:    yeah
H:    to keep it going
S:    but, don’t you think nowadays, (1.0) you know, w- we’re a little bit
      more educated about, erm, relationships, and about keeping
      relationships going, you know, as much as you know, I would- I would
      stand up to any young girl and say, ‘you do not put up with that in a
      relationship’, I would- I would stand up to them and say, ‘if you want
      a relationship to stay together, you need to still go out together,
      you still need to have a laugh together if y- you know, and put them
      into your marriage, or else, you know, that’s the way marriages go,
      they fail’
H:    but at the end of the day it’s still how can you always fit it in,
      because, when you’re both working y- you know what I mean, when you
      buy- I think if you get married and you buy a property
S:    yeah
H:    ninety percent of your time goes towards (0.5) your home, working for
      your home,
TIME [13.00]
H:    and that is sometimes, is that- like I say, we’re getting too
      materialistic in a lot of things
S:    yeah
H:    so, instead of, like you say, keeping the excitement and everything
      in your marriage
S:    mm
H:    things tend to go materialistic, ‘oh, we want this for the home and
      ooh, have you seen that over, ooh yeah, we’ll get one of them big
      massive screen tellys and’
S:    yeah
H:    and so all your time is getting the money together for all these
      little things
S:    yeah (0.5)
H:    and then that (0.5) that (0.5) takes away from your personal
      relationship
S:    don’t- don’t you think
H:    it’s about a collection of things round you
S:    don’t you think it’s more a case of (1.5) you know, ‘I can’t (0.5)
      leave (0.5) this set up because I’ve got- I’ve still got payments left
      on me car’
H:    [laugh]
S:    ‘or I’ve still-’ do you know what- I know it sounds sad
H:    yeah
S:    [inc] and it really does sound sad, but, I- I- I’ve gotta hand- hold
      me hand up, I’ve done that in the past, you know, thinking, ‘oh I
      can’t- can’t leave him this week, you know, I’ve still got payments
      left on me car’ and
H:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
S:    [laugh]
H:    [laugh] payments left on me car, oh my God, I suppose
S:    but I think it’s not all negative because I look at me stepson’s
      relationship (1.0) and I think men are much more hands on (0.5) with
      regard to children these days-
H:    ah yeah that is something that has- that’s changed
S:    cause they really lost out, men lost out didn’t they in the past
H:    I don’t think they lost out, I don’t think they wanted to be
      bothered, to be truthful with you
S:    yeah
H:    cause it was- I still remember Granddad [anon], he used to go to
      work, come home and sit in the corner with his paper and he didn’t
      like a lot of mither off
S:    oh God no
H:    kids, do you know, it was- that was his routine
S:    yeah, it was, ‘shh, don’t go in there, me Granddad’s in there’
H:    yeah
S:    yeah
H:    and it’s like whatsits Dad, his a- his attitude was, (2.0) ‘I go out
      to work (0.5) it’s my house (0.5) I pay the bills (0.5) and I’ll watch
      what I want on telly’ I mean, I’ve seen him come in switch- she’s been
      sat there
TIME [15.00]
H:    telly goes over (0.5) she goes to-
S:    you’re joking
H:    no, I’m not joking, like, that is the God’s honest truth
S:    switches the telly over?
H:    yeah
I:    [laugh]
S:    [laugh]
H:    he’d been out in the pub, he’s come in
S:    yeah
H:    she’s in the middle of a film,
S:    and he just-
H:    he just turned it- I was sat with her and I c- turned it over, and
      she went, ‘I was watching that’, ‘I pay the bills in this house, I’m
      the one that goes out to work, I’ll watch what I want’ (0.5) I was
      fuming
S:    [laugh]
H:    there was steam coming out me ears [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
H:    I come, ‘I’ve got to go now’
S:    [laugh]
H:    and I just walked out and I’m like this [ahhh]
S:    oh no
H:    it was- it was horrendous
S:    no
H:    and it was so funny cos they came to our house (0.5) and erm, [anon]
      asked, ‘erm, do you want a brew’ this that, ‘erm, yeah, yeah, go on,
      I’ll have a can, yeah, yeah, yeah’ and he goes erm, ‘ooh erm, such-and-
      such-a-body’s on’ and he turned the telly over, and he goes, ‘ooh,
      it’s good this, it’s good match this’ and I just got the remote, I
      come (2.0) ‘I pay the bills in here, we don’t watch sport in this
      house’
TIME [16.00]
I:    [laugh]
S:    [laugh]
H:    and he walked, I thought there’s no way (0.5) you can do that in your
      home, you’re not doing it in mine
S:    ahh
H:    do you know what I mean, and they went [laugh] they left-
S:    do you know, honestly
H:    but- but
S:    and you probably caused a big bloody argument through that
I:    [laugh]
H:    argument, but (0.5) that’s what I’m saying, that was the way then
S:    yeah
H:    the women stayed at home, they cleaned the house, they looked after
      the children, the men went to work, had a pint, come home, tea on the
      table, (0.5)
S:    yeah (0.5) mm
H:    and they didn’t want no mither
S:    no
H:    do you know, mm, and that was the routine
S:    mm
H:    and it was more the women that had the social circle like I say, all
      the neighbours
S:    yeah
H:    and everything, the men it was, down the pub (0.5)
S:    yeah, I remember when we was kids, we had loads of Auntys
H:    yeah
S:    who weren’t our Auntys
H:    Auntys, no, no,
S:    but-
H:    but it was always
S:    yeah
H:    Aunty [anon], cos you didn’t go, (0.5) Mrs [anon] or Mrs [anon]
S:    no
H:    it was Aunty [anon], Aunty [anon], Aunty [anon], you know
S:    yeah
H:    they were all Aunties
S:    yeah
I:    mm
H:    and like I say
TIME [17.00]
H:    you did summet wrong, they didn’t go running telling your Mum, you
      got a clip round the ear
S:    mm
H:    and if you went and told your Mum, you’d get another one
S:    got another one [laugh]
H:    yeah, and it was ‘well, you must’ve deserved it’
S:    yeah
H:    cause I can still remember that
S:    yeah
H:    cause they don’t- they’re not gonna crack you for nothing
S:    no
H:    and it wasn’t a whack, it was just, like you say, a clip round the
      ear, ‘eh, you little bugger, what do you think you’re doing’
S:    yeah, yeah
H:    but you can’t-
S:    there was nothing abusive in it
H:    no
S:    it was just a case of, you know, ‘when your Mam’s not here, I’m your
      Mam’
H:    yeah
S:    ‘you do what you’re told’
H:    told, yeah now you can’t e- there’s no way you can do any of that,
      and I tell you what an- irritates me (0.5) with (0.5) the grandkids,
      the eldest in particular (0.5) these mobile phones,
S:    yeah
H:    you can’t have a decent conversation with them because it’s, ‘erm,
      yeah oh alri- alright Nanna, erm, (0.5) what was that, what, erm, oh
      alright, yeah, yeah’
S:    [laugh] texting
H:    and they’re like this
TIME [18.00]
S:    while- while they’re on
H:    so that you know they’re not listening to you
S:    [laugh]
H:    they’re too busy on-
I:    kids eh [laugh]
S:    yeah [laugh]
H:    on- on- on the phone- on the phone texting
S:    yeah, fingers going
H:    and when they- when they’ve text me, right, have you ever got one of
      these texts, and I’m going, ‘what the (0.5) what’ and I put two pairs
      of glasses on and I still don’t understand it and it’s all text
      writing
S:    code (0.5) code, yeah
H:    all text writing, and I wonder, you know like y- y- everything
      evolves, you know like erm, years and years and years ago they used to
      speak all drawn out and everything
S:    yeah
H:    and like you say, we’ve shortened it, do you think we’ll end up
      writing like they text now (0.5) in years to come
S:    we may well do, we may well do
H:    do you know another- another change
S:    yeah and- well, I mean things evolve don’t they
H:    yeah because I’ve- I said to someone, no so long ago, I says (0.5)
TIME [19.00]
H:    the way they used to talk, ‘thou shalt do’ you know
S:    yeah
H:    years ago, the ways they used to write and do that
S:    yeah
H:    I says, and then it all got changed to more a less speaking- writing
      how you speak,
S:    yeah
H:    and now, is it gonna be, you’re writing how you text
S:    well it is, it is, I mean y- w-
H:    do you know, and so that could be another
S:    when y- you email people now, you shorten everything
H:    yeah
S:    I mean I’ve learned a few of them, like, I mean, L-O-L is ‘laugh out
      loud’
H:    is it? I thought it was ‘lots of love’ [laugh]
S:    [laugh] ha, ha, ha, no, ‘mwah’ is a kiss M-W-A-H, mwah [kiss] like
      that
H:    right
S:    but the best one that I’ve learnt that use quite a lot actually, is P-
      M-L, in capitals,
H:    what’s that?
S:    pissed meself laughing [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
H:    ooh [laugh] but that’s it, I j- I thought L-O-L was ‘lots of love’
      because a lot of people do that at the end of a text, ‘right, going
      now, bye, L-O-L’, so I thought it was ‘lots of love’, erm, and I- if-
      I’ve started doing little bits like,
TIME [20.00]
H:    (0.5) if I’m texting [anon], erm, (1.5) ‘are you on your way’ and
      I’ll put, just an ‘R’, then a ‘U’
S:    yeah
H:    do you know like,
S:    yeah
H:    that- little things like that, but I don’t know all the others that
      they do
S:    no, well we’ll have to learn because I mean- it-
H:    but that’s what I’m saying
S:    it’s so- so much quicker, when you’re- you know, you’re emailing
      somebody
H:    yeah, yeah, but that’s what I’m saying, I think this
S:    right
H:    is gonna change the whole thing again
S:    yeah
H:    because it’s all computers, it’s all erm, mobile phones and texting
S:    yeah
H:    so I do think in the next ten years, it’s all gonna change again and,
      people are gonna be writing like- it’s like a shorthand isn’t it,
      really,
S:    yeah
H:    instead of- cos I know our [anon] says, ‘it takes you bleeding ages
      to text me back’ [laugh]
S:    [laugh]
H:    because I do the whole thing, you know
S:    [laugh]
H:    ‘and’ and ‘the’ and everything is wrote, you know,

      takes me ten minutes

S:    mm
H:    do you know what I mean, I’m getting a bit quicker now but at first
      I’d g- I’d get bored before I got to the end of what I was trying to
      say

H:    do you know
S:    well I was on- on the laptop, erm, last week it was, erm and I’m

      name as me

      everything’

H:    ‘and we have a right laugh, and I met a few people’, I says, ‘oh
      right’, well the first thing, I we- I went into hysterics, cos I says,
      ‘ooh, what is it, I’ll have a go at that’ she goes, ‘ooh, it’s called
      plenty of fish’, well
S:    [laugh]
H:    I set off laughing, I says ‘it’s called what?’, she says, ‘plenty of
      fish’
S:    [laugh]
H:    she says, ‘the only trouble is’ she says, ‘you have to be careful cos
      some of them are only after one thing’ I says, ‘well do you think that
      could be because of the name of the site?’
I:    [laugh]
H:    you know, ‘plenty of fish’, she says, ‘I never thought of that’, well
      I was- I nearly choked laughing

      it again’ and she won’t
S:    yeah
H:    sh- you know, it- in fact she lost her email address because it had
      been that long (1.5)
S:    right
H:    since she’s been on it, and the- after a while, I didn’t realise, our
      [anon] says, ‘oh yeah, if you’ve not used your email address for a
      long time (0.5) they squash it and you have to start up again’
TIME [28.00]
I:    mm
S:    ooh I didn’t know that

      don’t I
S:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
H:    I did it for her, I sorted it out, and got her back on (0.5) but erm,
      she still doesn’t go on it much, and I mean it would benefit her
S:    hmm
H:    with her being deaf
S:    yeah
H:    you know,
S:    yeah
H:    I mean she only texts anyway when she uses her phone, [gasp] what a
      performance I’ve had with that (0.5) she went to erm, Salford to get a
      new phone (1.5) and I could see people looking at us, and some of them
      tittering, she says, ‘but I need a phone’ she says, ‘that has got a
      good vibrator on it’ [laugh]
S:    [laugh] ca-
H:    and we’re in the middle on this shop and I’m thinking, ‘oh God’, she
      says, ‘because the last phone I got’ she says, ‘the vibration was no
      good, I couldn’t feel it’ she says, erm, ‘and I was missing all me
      calls’ [laugh]
S:    [laugh]
TIME [29.00]
H:    [laugh]
S:    [laugh] ah no
H:    so I’m there saying, ‘look, she’s deaf, she needs a phone with a
      decent vibration on it so that when it’s in her back pocket she can
      feel it’
S:    yeah
H:    I says, ‘the other phone that she got she ended up swapping because
      it was no good to her, she was missing everything’ (0.5) ‘right,
      okay’, and she wanted one with a good camera on it, and we were going
      through anyway-
S:    wouldn’t you think though, that, you know, compa- phone companies w-
      would make phones specifically for deaf people
H:    I know well that’s-
S:    as a communication device I mean
H:    yeah
S:    you know
H:    that’s- that’s one thing that they are lacking in
S:    right
H:    because, she has-
S:    right
H:    sh- when we go, we don’t go for a new phone and we’re in and out in a-
       in an hour
S:    mm
H:    we can be in there two or three hours
S:    yeah
H:    because she’s there and they’re putting- they (0.5) ringing all these
      phones and she’s holding them trying to say (0.5)
S:    yeah
H:    ‘no, that’s no good, that’s no good’, you know, and I think- and I
      don’t- the worst thing is, she takes me with her, and I don’t know the
      first thing
TIME [30.00]
H:    about phones so I’m neither use nor ornament
S:    yeah
H:    so she gets this phone home (2.5) it was spent more time at home than
      it did with her because the battery was going flat all the time, she
      was charging it up every other day (1.0) and what else, there was a f-
      there was about three things wrong with it (0.5) so we checked the
      agreement and it says you can change it- you can cancel it within
      seven days, so she said, ‘right’, so she types this letter out at work
      (0.5) stops off at Salford, she says, ‘right, I don’t want this
      anymore’ (0.5) ‘cancelling me contract’ they said, ‘you can’t do this-
      that’ she says, ‘yeah, oh yes I can’, ‘oh, you’ve got to do it in
      writing’, she goes, ‘there it is, copy for you, copy for me’, ‘no
      you’ve got to send it to ‘ead o- head office’ and all this that and
      the other (0.5) so she had a big row with them (0.5) she- she left the
      phone on the desk, they says, ‘no, no, you can’t leave it here’, she
      says, ‘yes, I can (0.5) I’m leaving it, I’m cancelling everything’,
      and she went out the shop shouting,
TIME [31.00]
H:    ‘you’re all mad if you get a phone from here’ [laugh]
S:    [laugh] oh God
I:    [laugh]
H:    I thought-
S:    I can just see her doing that and all
H:    I know, she’s dead erm, she’s dead bolshy isn’t she
S:    [laugh]
H:    I thought, I’m glad I wasn’t with her, but anyway, they’ve sent her a
      letter back saying, yes, she can cancel the contract, but she’s got to
      pick the phone up, and she’s gotta ring them and then they’ve got to
      arrange to pick it up and all this that and the other, I thought (0.5)


S:    yeah
H:    why not just give it back to the shop
S:    yeah
H:    and leave it at that, so that’s what-
S:    but I bet- did she pick it up from the shop?
H:    yeah
S:    right
H:    yeah
S:    cause the-
H:    she went in the shop and got it from the shop, so why not just take
      it back to the shop
S:    yeah (1.0) yeah
H:    so, but that’s what she’s got to do, so that’s what I’ll have to do
      later on, erm,
S:    go and see my mate down there, [anon]

      want the latest one Mam, because, (0.5) it’s only just come out and
      then they’ll find out all the problems and this, that and the other
      with it’
S:    yeah, yeah
H:    she says, ‘so I’ll wait a- a bit and then I might in two years I’ll
      update it again’
S:    mm
H:    she says, ‘but I’m happy with this one now and it does this and it
      does-’ oh, she spends hours messing about, but, in saying about the-
      the computer
S:    mm
H:    that’s got it in, so she gets her emails through that anyway
S:    yeah, yeah
H:    so- cos she’s been saying to me, ‘ooh, I got a birthday card off
      [anon] and erm, I’ve got, erm, one off-’ (0.5) who er- can’t remember
      who else, but she got birthday cards sent to her over the erm

      she turned her phone round, and there was our front door, on her phone-
       on her phone- I- my front door was on her phone’ and I went, ‘yeah,
      well it’ll be an iphone, and they’ve got satellite navigation and all
      that’, ‘well, I want one’
TIME [34.00]
H:    [burp]
S:    [laugh] I said, ‘but you still don’t know how to text’
H:    to text, yeah
S:    ‘I’ll learn’
H:    yeah
S:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
H:    that’s it, th- th- they are good, if you’re into gadgets
I:    mmhmm
H:    but I’m not into gadgets, I can’t- one-
S:    I think they’ve gotta be something that you’re gonna use isn’t it
H:    yeah,
S:    you know
H:    me eyes are bad, and, even my phone I’ve got now
S:    mm
H:    I’m like this, and I’m putting two pairs of glasses on reading it, so
      to start messing about and trying to learn
S:    yeah
H:    how to do this, that and the other on a phone, that- I’m gonna
      struggle to see anyway
S:    yeah
H:    it doesn’t seem worth it to me, as long as I can text and phone,
      (0.5) that’s all I’m bothered about
S:    yeah
H:    I mean I can’t even use the camera properly on this or- or the, erm,
      (0.5) video thing
S:    mm
H:    I c- I- it’s- you can change the length of time
S:    yeah
H:    I still can’t do it (0.5) I take a picture, it’s funny, I take a
      picture like that, (0.5) and I press the button (1.5) and I go like
      that to look at it, and then it’ll go ‘click’
TIME [35.00]
S:    [laugh]
H:    but I’ve moved- it’s like (0.5) a delayed thing on it
S:    yeah, yeah
I:    mm
H:    and I don’t know how to get it off
S:    right
H:    so I can’t even take a proper picture when I want to, (0.5) it ends
      up something else cos I’ve moved the-
S:    did you get a disc with it? (0.5)
H:    probably, but I never use that either [laugh] I never- I never put
      them in to see-
S:    I- all- all I’m saying is, I mean I’m- I’m no techy at all, but,
      whenever I’ve got anything, like I’ve got a camera, or satnav or, you
      get a disc with it, and then, when you’ve got the time, and, you know
      me, I never- I never even look at a recipe I just think I can cook,
      throw it all in together, but I- I’ll be thinking to meself, ‘ooh, I
      don’t know how to use that video bit on me camera’
H:    yeah (0.5)
S:    but all I’ll do is either go on the computer or go on the little
      pamphlet, and they’re dead easy to use nowadays
H:    yeah
S:    it’s just having the patience to sit down
H:    down
S:    and- and actually read through it
H:    and actu- read through it, yeah
S:    cause they are easy, you know, everything’s like user friendly these
      days, they’re not like they used to be, cos I- you know, manuals used
      to be unless you had a degree
TIME [36.00]
S:    (0.5) you couldn’t (0.5) bloody read it,
H:    under- I know
S:    never mind understand what was on them
H:    I g- I always go, ‘what does that mean?’ [laugh], ‘what’s that word
      there, what does it mean?’ [laugh]
S:    [laugh] yeah
H:    [laugh] oh God, but that’s it, it takes me that long to read summet
      I’ve got fed up with it
S:    but I think you get frightened of things, and I think you’re just-
      you have like a- a mental blinker
H:    yeah
S:    and you think, ‘I’m just ne- I’m not gonna be able to use that’ (0.5)
      erm, because me Dad’s not got a mobile phone, and me Mum’s been
      saying, ‘well, you know, when I get me iphone, your Dad can have my-
      my old one’ (1.0) erm, and I say, ‘well I’ll be able to teach him how
      to use it’ cos I am good at showing people what
H:    yeah
S:    you know, how to use thing- things, but (0.5) you know, I think
      sometimes you just get mental block where you think, ‘I’m never gonna
      be able to do it’, so you’re preventing yourself from- from- from
      learning
H:    yeah
S:    erm, in a way
H:    I know, I m- that is- that is true, it’s like me, I was scared of the
      [burp] laptop, I was scared to (0.5) death breaking it
TIME [37.00]
S:    right, pressing the wrong thing?
H:    yeah, and, I think that came from when I was working and I was ill
      and I was in the office this time and they said, ‘oh, just put these
      facts and figures in’ I says, ‘oh I don’t know anything’, ‘oh, we’ll
      show you’, ‘I- I’m scared of losing the data’, ‘you can’t lose the
      data’, fine, fair enough, and they showed me how to do this, and I was
      doing it for weeks, and then I got cocky, starting- trying to play
      about with it
S:    mm
H:    and the next minute it all went off and I says, ‘ooh, there’s summet-
      ooh’ I says, ‘you said I can’t lose this data didn’t you’, ‘yeah’,
      ‘oh, well, come and sort it out then, cos it’s all gone black’ and the
      next minute he goes, ‘I don’t believe it Harriet [anon] you’ve lost
      the data’
S:    [laugh]
H:    I says, ‘you told me I couldn’t do that’ I says, ‘so it’s your fault,
      it’s not mine’
S:    there’s o- there’s only one person who could’ve lost the data and it
      was you
H:    yeah, it was, and the thing was (1.5) I was dead worried but, because
      he’d said, ‘oh no, you’re alright, it- you can’t lose it’
S:    yeah
H:    I got cocky and I thought, ‘ooh, well I can’t do any damage’, so you
      start messing round- and he’d says to me
TIME [38.00]
H:    ‘just have a go, keep playing with it and learning, and you’ll become
      more confident’, so I did
S:    yeah
H:    and then I lost everything
S:    [laugh]
H:    and he said, ‘no, just keep to what you was doing before, just put
      the data in’, ‘right’ (0.5) but, that’s why when I got mine it was,
      hmm (0.5)
S:    yeah
H:    you know, viruses, all I heard about was virus- say I put a virus in
      it, I don’t know how you-
S:    mm
H:    I could put a virus in it but (0.5) and (1.0) so it was (2.0)
      touching the odd key like that, ‘ooh what’s happened, what-’ and
      that’s all you got out of me for the first month, ‘ooh, what’s
      happened, what’ve I done, what’ve I done’ (1.0) but you need to learn
      what the keys do and what they don’t do
S:    course you do, yeah
H:    and that was my problem, our [anon] was saying to me ages ago, he’s
      texting me, you know, when he- and he- he’s on facebook and he’s-
S:    yeah
H:    leaving me a message and- and the name pops up, and then you type in
      there and I thought
TIME [39.00]
H:    ‘ooh right’, so I typed some- he says, ‘just type in at the bottom’
      so I just typed in at the bottom (0.5) and then I thought, ‘right, now
      what do I do with it?’ (0.5) and, I clicked on it and it went off, and
      I did this, that (1.5) and in the end I went a- the long way round
S:    mm
H:    to text him what I’d just wrote in that square cos I couldn’t send it
      to him, I didn’t know how to send it
S:    yeah (0.5)
H:    and then, who was it (0.5) [anon], granddaughter, (0.5)
S:    just press the return key
H:    yeah, ‘you press that Nanna’ (0.5) ‘right, okay’, but I was coming
      out of that
S:    yeah
H:    getting his name up and going the long way round because I didn’t
      know how to send
S:    yeah
H:    in that, it- and, it- unless you know what all the keys do
I:    mm
H:    y-
S:    and that’s e- exactly right y- you know, a- and everybody, everybody,
      ah kid, is exactly the same, you know, when you first look at
      computer, unless you’ve been shown what to do, how are you supposed to
      know?
H:    yeah, the best of it is I went to erm, (0.5) the erm, oh what’s it
      called
TIME [40.00]
H:    in Eccles and they were doing computer courses for free
S:    oh yeah
H:    and if you went regular and you passed through the course, they’d
      give you a computer, wh- you know
S:    right
H:    and you could keep it for so long and then pay fifty pound for it,
      something like that
S:    right
H:    I thought, ‘ooh, I’ll get a computer’ (2.0) and, I was going there
      learning and I h- I had a file and me discs and everything and I
      started to learn a bit
S:    yeah
H:    but then (0.5) I think she was off ill and I’d gone all the way to
      Eccles a couple of weeks, and nobody had bothered ringing me and kept
      saying, ‘ooh, she’s not here this week, she’s not come in’, ‘oh, she’s
      not’ and in the end I just sacked it
S:    yeah
H:    otherwise- but thinking about it, I only found all that information
      in the disc (0.5) when was it, was it yesterday or the day before when
      I was looking for something for [anon]
S:    mm
H:    so I might get that out and put it in and start (0.5)
S:    yeah
H:    trying to learn a bit more
S:    yeah
TIME [41.00]
H:    but like I say, I’m sure it has the keyboard
S:    you see, it’s-
H:    it- on it
S:    it’s amazing though I mean how quickly things change, I mean I
      remember doing erm, a computer course (0.5) it’s not ten years ago, at
      night school, erm, cos you know our- our [anon] did computers at- at
      college and that, and I thought, ‘we’ve got a bloody big computer in
      there and you know, when I’m on me day off it’s sat there doing
      nothing, I may as well learn how to use it’
H:    yeah
S:    so I went on a computer course and one of the first things they
      showed me how to do, erm, was put something on a floppy disc, we don’t
      use floppy discs anymore, who uses floppy discs now
H:    what’s a floppy disc? (0.5)
S:    it’s a small disc (0.5)
H:    like erm- like a CD?
S:    yeah, yeah
H:    I thought they- I thought
S:    no, no, no, no, no, it’s not, what am I talking about, it- they used
      to be like in a square
H:    [gasp] that’s what I’ve got
S:    yeah, but nobody uses them these days
H:    you know from my computer course, that’s what it is
S:    they use them little (0.5) I’ve got one, dongle thingies, it’s not a
      dongle
TIME [42.00]
S:    you put it in the side of the computer and you save it on to- on to
      that
I:    memory stick
S:    a memory stick, yeah, that’s it, that’s what they’re called
H:    oh right
S:    but that- that wasn’t ten years ago, and yet things have changed
      already
H:    that’s what I’m saying, the technology nowadays is changing that fast
S:    yeah
H:    people who are a bit slow, it’s very hard
S:    [laugh]
H:    to catch up
S:    [laugh]
H:    do you know what I mean? I- probably, I’ll get dead good, on the
      computer and the laptop, and then they’ll go and change it to
      something else and I’ll have to start from scratch, and it’s (0.5) I-
      you give up in the end, I- I do
S:    I think the- the- I think the- there’ll always be a qwerty keyboard,
      there’ll always be a qwerty keyboard, on what- on whatever technology
      that you’re gonna use, cos that’s our form of communication in the
      West [laugh]
H:    eh well, we’ll see
S:    so (0.5) you’ll be right
H:    yeah, like I say, I’m gonna keep trying and erm, so (1.0) that floppy
      disc
S:    yeah
H:    what makes me laugh, is why do they call it floppy cos it’s as stiff
      as a board
TIME [43.00]
S:    [laugh]
H:    why if- if- if I’ve got one of them would I be able to put it in my
      computer, it is a computer, it’s not a- a laptop
S:    yeah
H:    would I?
S:    yeah
H:    right, cos I might have a go at that (0.5)
S:    mm
H:    and erm, try and learn a bit more (0.5) we even went, me and our
      [anon], he says erm, ‘oh, there’s a computer course starting’ so
      being, he says, ‘right’ I says, ‘I’ll come with you’ he asks me, I
      says ‘yeah, okay, I’ll come with you’, and it was in [anon]
S:    oh yeah
H:    so I got us on, we went down (0.5) we was- th- there was only me and
      him there and the (1.0) tutor (0.5) and, we did this course, then the
      week after, (0.5) it was really bad storms, I think it was advised, if
      you didn’t have to go out, don’t go out
S:    yeah
H:    so I says, ‘we’re not going [anon], I’m not going in this, it’s
      really too bad, and I don’t want you driving up here’, ‘right, okay’,
      so the week after that, we went again, (0.5) ‘oh, they’ve cancelled
      it’, you know, ‘not enough people turned up’
S:    yeah (0.5)
TIME [44.00]
H:    so,
S:    yeah
H:    I didn’t even do that, cos a lot of people now have- are learning off
      their kids (0.5)
S:    yeah
H:    because the kids are doing it in school now
S:    mm (0.5)
H:    the kids are showing the parents how to use a computer
S:    well I know our [anon] erm, give me a disc, ooh, I’m ashamed to say,
      God knows where it is, but I think it- think it was called ECDL, but
      that was literally, you taught yourself how to use a computer from the
      CD, you just loaded the CD, and then it, you know, talked you how to
      go through what to do, and I thought, ‘ooh, how fantastic’, but,
      they’re something like seventy pound I think
I:    mm
S:    she got it because of- she got it through work, erm, so they wanna be
      giving them- them out in erm, these lessons and say like, well do this
      in- in lesson and then
H:    well, you’ll have to find that
S:    yeah
H:    cause that might do me
S:    mm
H:    that might help me
S:    yeah, and it’s not so much- I mean I’m pretty computer literate (0.5)
      but sometimes it’s the language they use
H:    yeah
S:    you know, that
TIME [45.00]
S:    that is confusing cos they just think, ‘upload’, ‘upl- what does up-
      upload mean?’
H:    upload mean? Yeah, I’m like that
S:    yeah
H:    cause I- I d- I don’t know how to- you can put things on a disc can’t
      you? (1.5) you know, if you wanted (0.5) erm, say a song (0.5)
S:    yeah
H:    and you put a disc in and you could b-
S:    rip and burn,
H:    yeah
S:    yeah
H:    you can do that, or, any information you can put on a disc, I can’t
      do things like that, I don’t know h- I’ve got the facility
S:    yeah, within your computer
H:    but, I don’t know how to do it
S:    yeah
H:    and that’s something I would like to do, cos I’d like to be able to
      download photographs
S:    mm
H:    and you know, even, you know, different things
S:    mm
H:    I’d love to be able to do that
S:    mm
H:    but I don’t know how to do that
S:    right, you see that’s dead, dead easy, I’d be able to show you that
H:    yeah
S:    erm, but I tell you on- one good tip, that somebody told me years
      ago, erm, on a computer is, you know all you get- get a question mark,
      wherever you are, there’s that, either question mark or a help
TIME [46.00]
S:    just click on that if y- if you’re stuck on it and somewhere it’ll
      explain how to do what you want to do, cos what I tend to do is I
      always have a- like a pad at the side of the computer and then,
      whatever it tells me to do, I’ll write it down, and some of the things
      are so easy, it’s like, ‘click on start, click on programs, click on
      this, click on that, click on that, click on that, right, change that
      to a ‘no’, you’re sorted’
H:    what it is-
S:    and I’ll never remember it, like
H:    yeah
S:    the following day, once I’ve slept, that’s it, but once it’s written
      down, it’s written out, ‘start, de, programs, blah, blah, blah’
H:    yeah, but what it is, because it’s a computer, and it’s a complicated
      piece of equipment, you look at it, and you go, ‘ooh, I don’t know how
      to do this’, ‘ooh, I can I-’ because you think it’s gonna be
      complicated
S:    yeah, yeah
H:    and then when someone shows you, you go, ‘oh, is that it’ and
S:    yeah, yeah
H:    you’re dead surprised
I:    yeah
H:    it’s so simple
S:    yeah
H:    but, because you’re looking at this equipment and you’re thinking,
      ‘it must be complicated’
TIME [47.00]
H:    like you say, you’re mind goes blank,
S:    mm
H:    it’s like a mental block
S:    yeah
H:    and you don’t see the simple little things that come up that say,
      ‘just press here’, or ‘just do thi-’
S:    mm
H:    y- it- you don’t see it, it’s like a mental blindness cos y- you
      panic
S:    yeah, yeah
H:    you don’t see it
S:    you do, you get blinkered, what I- what I used- when I was training,
      what I used to do with anyone in- in my office was say, right, there’s
      your pad, and I mean them days we used to call them an idiot guide,
      you’re not allowed to do that anymore, erm, but, say for example it
      was like, you know, rip and burn, like, ‘click on that, click on that,
      click on that, click on that’ right, now write it down, in those short
      phrases, not, ‘put your disc in this’, just ‘click, click, click,
      click’ like a- a small, short, a reminder,
H:    yeah
S:    erm, and that’s it, right, you put that away, don’t look at it,
      right, now you’ve not done rip and burning for six months, right, get
      your idiot guide, get it out, ‘oh yeah’, click, click, click, click,
      click,
H:    click, click, click,
S:    and it’s easy then
H:    yeah
TIME [48.00]
S:    it becomes dead easy, and y’kn- y- th- it- it takes away the fear,
      because it’ll be something, you know, it- and I don’t care who you
      are, however brainy you are that you’ll- you’ll just forget
H:    yeah
S:    what do I go into for that
H:    to for that, yeah
S:    erm, and it- it’s just there for you
H:    yeah (0.5) I’ll have to get stuck in me (0.5) and erm, (1.0) try a
      bit harder, get to know everything properly
S:    I know
H:    right (0.5) how are we doing?
I:    I think that’s alright that, yep, I was just letting you finish off,
      great
H:    good, cos I’m bursting for a pee [laugh]
I:    are you [laugh]
S:    [laugh]
I:    right one sec,
H:    can I-
I:    get this going again, can you just talk for me
H:    one, two-
I:    oh hang on
H:    oh right
