B:    Barney           [Left]
I:    Interviewer
O:    Other            [female]

I:    Yeah. Can you just count to three please.
A:    One, two, three.
I:    Yeah. Ok that’s great. When you’re ready.
B:    Ok Arnold [anon]. I’ll kick off- we’ll kick off with you shall we?
      [laugh]
A:    What?
B:    Your best or funniest memory.
A:    Best or funniest memory from when I was young.
B:    When you were young.
A:    Erm-
B:    Can you remember that far back?
I:    [laugh]
A:    [exhales] w- h- how young are we talking about here?
B:    Well-
A:    Very young.
B:    Again it depends really on how far back you can remember [laugh].
I:    [laugh]
A:    Yeah, (2.5) I think the best- probably the best memory I have of- of
      being young is- is Christmas time when all the family used to get
      together in those days we- we always had all our aunts and uncles and
      cousins round on Christmas day and-
I:    Yeah.
TIME [01:00]
A:    and erm- we- w- there wasn’t an awful lot of money but erm we used to
      have quite a big s- slap up meal at lunchtimes and lots of games and
      lots of fun. No television  of course in those days so yeah that’s
      probably the best memory I’ve got from being young.
B:    How young were you then? When you did-
A:    Oh from-
B:    when you did change?
A:    I would think that was from being- from as early as I can remember
      being through- going through to being about twelve. Something like
      that.
B:    So your life changed soon after you’ve met me? [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
A:    Yeah, yeah, yeah.
B:    [laugh] Yeah.
A:    But erm a- as- as people grew older they didn’t want to-
TIME [02:00]
A:    families got bigger as well. They did-
B:    Yeah.
A:    th- they didn’t get together the same.
B:    Up to that age I erm- I think my Christmases were very similar in
      that people came to us for a Christmas lunch. But because the erm,
      accomodation that we had at the time was a bit cramped all the
      children went into the back room and the adults were in the main
      dining room cos that’s when we lived at the laundry. We had a chinese
      laundry in those days.
I:    Really?
B:    And the- the front room was shop.
I:    Yeah.
B:    It was where we did the ironing, stored the laundry that had been
      packaged.
I:    Mm.
B:    And the middle room was the living room where we did everything
      [laugh].
I:    [laugh]
B:    And the back room was the stove room.
TIME [03:00]
B:    There was a coal fired stove with flat irons against it. But there
      was a big table in there as well. So that’s where the kids sat to have
      their Christmas dinner. But it was still good fun and happy times.
A:    How many of you?
B:    In total people- oh- well there was-
A:    Kids.
B:    three six erm I- I can’t think of it. Two sisters at the time [anon]
      and [anon], myself. [anon] wasn’t with us then.
I:    Oh ok.
B:    [anon] was an after thought.
I:    [laugh] yeah
B:    [laugh] I think my mum thought she was going to get a new washing
      machine for Christmas you know. She got [anon] instead.
A:    Mm.
B:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
B:    Erm then there’d be my three cousins [anon], (2.5) [anon]. You’ve met
      [anon] haven’t you?
A:    Yeah.
B:    From [anon].
A:    Yeah. [anon].
B:    And [anon].
A:    Mm.
B:    And erm-
TIME [04:00]
B:    and there’d be my grandad. Auntie [anon], mum, dad, uncle [anon] and
      auntie [anon] they were [anon] parents. Uncle [anon] and auntie [anon]
      they were Pamela’s [anon] parents. Auntie [anon] used to come on her
      own because grandad didn’t like uncle [anon]-
I:    [laugh]
A:    [laugh]
B:    and uncle [anon] didn’t like Grandad [coughs]. So he- [laugh] had the-
       he had Christmas dinner with his mother.
I:    Aw.
B:    So there was a lot of us.
A:    Mm.
B:    And erm the odd friend. People like that used to pop in throughout
      the day. Erm- but one of the most memorable things as a kid happened
      when I was at the laundry. Erm when me grandmother was alive she used
      to make beetroot wine.
I:    Ok.
B:    And you had to wait for it to mature-
TIME [05:00]
B:     before you drank it. But I was being a little bit eager and I opened
      one before it was ready and it was like champagne and this red fizz
      went a- all over-
I:    Ah- oh no.
B:    [coughs] freshly laudered sheets, shirts, pillow cases.
I:    Ha.
B:    A whole days washing was absolutely ruined. And I think I went to me
      bedroom, locked it, and I was there for two day [laugh].
I:    [laugh]
B:    I was scared stiff of me grandad.
A:    Hm.
B:    He really did rule the roost.
I:    Really?
B:    Yeah. Fearsome character but erm extremely kind as well [laugh]-
I:    [laugh]
B:    and hard working.
I:    Yeah.
B:    His day used to start at about six o clock in the morning and go on
      till three o’clock the following morning.
I:    Wow.
B:    That was Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Thursday, Friday, Saturday his
      day started at nine and finished about five.
TIME [06:00]
I:    Yeah.
B:    But the laundry was all done by then and it was just a question of
      taking in new stuff  and delivering your- or doleing out the laundered
      stuff to the erm- the regular customers cos they nearly all were
      regulars in those days.
I:    Yeah.
B:    They all had their own laundry mark which was written on the back of
      their laundry in small chinese writing [laugh]
A:    Mm.
I:    Mm.
B:    We didn’t know the names we just knew the mark [laugh]
A:    Mm.
I:    [laugh]
B:    Yeah but that was all before I knew you wasn’t it Arnold [anon] the
      erm-
A:    That’s right yeah.
B:    the laundry.
A:    Yeah.
B:    You hardly ever went did you to the laundry?
A:    No I never went to the laundry no. We- we had erm- when I was nine
      year old we- we moved into a shop. We used to have a shop in [anon].
      My mother’s ran the shop. It was erm-
I:    Mm.
A:    ladies and children’s wear shop.
TIME [07:00]
I:    Oh ok.
A:    We had a few different sidelines as well. And my mother used to work
      six days a week in that.
I:    Yeah.
A:    Me dad was an engineer so he went out to work where he used to help
      on a Saturday.
I:    [inc]
B:    Yes love.
A:    And erm when we were there for six years altogether and erm one of
      the things I think I’ve mentioned this to Barney [anon] before that
      always sticks in my mind that was on- on a Saturday because my mother
      was still working in the shop-
I:    Yeah.
A:    I used to go to the local chip shop for lunch and I used to get three
      lots of fish and chips for half a crown in total. Now half a crown was
      twelve and a half pence. So that just shows how prices have changed.
I:    Yeah.
TIME [08:00]
A:    But erm one of the best things about living there was the fact that
      we had a double cellar and in the cellar we used to have a- a shooting
      range.
I:    Wow.
A:    With an air rifle.
I:    [laugh]
B:    [laugh]
A:    Erm and my dad would set up so you could- you could- you could put
      targets- three targets in at one end-
I:    Yeah.
A:    and th- and then shoot down this little-
I:    [laugh]
A:    walled area and erm-
B:    [sigh]
A:    we also used to do photography as well in the cellar. We used to d-
      do our own developing and printing and erm cos we had running water in
      this cellar. We had a sink in the corner so- so erm yeah good times
      yeah. But it-
B:    Yeah we used to do some of that didn’t we at-
A:    We did that in erm-
B:    in my bedroom.
A:    in- in the attic didn’t we.
B:    Yeah in the attic but there was no running water there.
I:    [laugh]
A:    No.
B:    [laugh]
A:    Mm.
B:    I don’t know how we coped really.
A:    Yeah.
B:    [laugh]
TIME [09:00]
B:    We did everything in my bedroom.
I:    Right.
B:    There was a snooker table.
I:    Really? [laugh]
B:    Yeah and we did the photography on top of the snooker table.
I:          [laugh]
A:    That’s right.
B:    And when we weren’t doing the photography we were playing snooker.
      And somehow we managed to fit my bed at the other end.
I:    [laugh]
A:    Yeah. It was a big s- a big attic.
B:    Yeah.
A:    That was a big attic bedroom. And it wasn’t a small snooker table it
      was a three quarter size snooker table.
I:    Really?
B:    Yeah.
A:    Yeah.
B:    It was too big for a normal house and I gave it to erm a youth club-
I:    Mm.
B:    in [anon] and erm unfortunately it closed down soon afterwards didn’t
      it.
I:    Oh no [laugh].
A:    Mm mm.
B:    And I don’t know what happened to that table.
I:    Mm.
B:    Erm todays prices it was probably worth about five, six hundred
      pounds.
A:    Mm.
I:    Wow.
B:    But nobody wanted it cos nobody had room for it. Sign of the times.
TIME [10:00]
B:    [anon] taken my glasses away. I know it’s big print.
A:    Are they yours?
B:    Mm? It’s alright.
A:    Shall-
B:    I can read just fine.
A:    shall we move on to another-
B:    Yeah.
A:    question?
B:    Would you like some water? I’ll just get some.
I:     Do you want me to- I can get you some if you like.
B:    Will you? [inc]
I:    Yeah.
B:    We’ll carry on talking.
A:    Please.
I:    Where are the glasses?
B:    Ah. Ask [anon] she’ll know.
I:    Oh ok.
B:    [coughs]
A:    So-
B:    Were there a lot of kids to play with when you were growing up?
A:    There was when I- when I lived in [anon] before we moved to the shop.
      Erm there were quite a few kids in the street and they-
B:    Mm.
A:    erm all similar aged. Erm and because it was a cul-de-sac it had a
      sort of a- a- it opened out and there was a- a- a good play area for
      kids but we had all the fields at the back as well.
TIME [11:00]
A:    And erm yeah there were quite of- quite a number of erm both bl- boys
      and girls to play with.
B:    Yeah yeah.
A:    Erm I was saying the age difference probably was three or four years
      older than me to three or four years younger than me. So lots of kids.
B:    Yeah I was the same. We had lots of kids when I was at junior school
      because in those days most kids went to school near where they lived.
A:    Yeah yeah.
B:    Nobody went to school by car.
A:    No.
B:    I don’t know how we managed. Thank you.
A:    Thank you.
B:    You get a waitress service as well.
I:    [laugh]
A:    You got some- can I have one of those mats?
I:    Oh yeah.
A:    Thank you.
B:    Can I just say when we went to junior school all the kids lived near
      the school.
I:    Yeah.
B:    Nobody ever went to school in a car.
TIME [12:00]
B:    Not even the teachers.
I:    [laugh]
B:    [laugh]
I:    Really?
B:    They didn’t have cars did they. Oh I think maybe the headmaster did.
A:    Maybe I think b- by the time we went to grammar school they probably
      did-
B:    Yeah. Headmaster had one.
A:    but I don’t remember any of the- any of the teachers at junior school
      having-
B:    No
A:    cars at all. But at grammar school they used to park just behind-
      well- well I went to [anon] school. There’s- I did three years at
      [anon] school erm before I moved to [anon] where Barney [anon] was.
I:    Oh ok.
A:    Erm travelling from the shop in [anon] was about four miles to [anon]
      school from there and there were probably three or four teachers had
      cars in those days.
I:    Mm.
A:    And one of the- one of the erm- the thing that everybody envied was
      my cousin. He was in the sixth form when I started.
TIME [13:00]
A:    And he had a motorbike and he used to park this motorbike in the- in
      the little- there was a little extension to the playground where the
      teachers-
I:    [laugh]
A:    parked their cars. And he used to erm leave his bike there and I was
      the envy of the other kids when I got a lift home with him. [laugh]
B:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
A:    Yeah.
B:    Yeah. We had a g-
A:    Cause there were no crash helmets in those- you just got on the back
      and went didn’t you.
B:    Yeah there were always a couple of guys at [anon] school had
      motorbikes and they were always the ones that had girlfriends and erm-
I:    [laugh]
A:    Yeah.
B:    They’d imaged themselves on James Dean and erm-
A:    Mm.
B:    Tony Curtis-
A:    Mm.
B:    who you might’ve heard of.
I:    Yeah.
B:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
B:    And they were always the rebels who left school with no O-levels and
      erm-
I:    [inc]
A:    Yeah.
B:    [laugh] but lots of girlfriends.
I:    [laugh] yeah.
B:    Lots of reputation behind them-
A:    Mm.
B:    which they c- couldn’t put on theirs CVs [laugh].
TIME [14:00]
I:    [laugh]
B:    But at junior school lots of kids to play with. Erm-
A:    Mm.
B:    Out- out playing everyday. Erm I don’t think our parents had any
      fears about us going out and s- being out.
A:    No no.
B:    Erm-
A:    When we lived at the shop in [anon] there was just down the lane was
      a park with swings and- and roundabouts and-
I:    Yeah.
B:    [coughs]
A:    sliding and erm we used to spend all day there sometimes you know you-
       you didn’t w- h- worry about your kids being out.
I:    No.
A:    Never heard of paedophiles and erm-
B:    Well it was a word that hadn’t been invented I don’t think.
A:    Erm I don’t think it had no and-
B:    Erm we had one in Eccles who I now realise was a paedophile.
I:    Yeah.
B:    Everyone knew him so you just avoided him.
TIME [15:00]
B:    He was called [anon]. [laugh]
A:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
A:    Yeah.
B:    and he wore a big fedora-
A:    Yeah.
B:    hat.
A:    Keep it anonymous. [laugh]
B:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
A:    Yeah.
B:    Yeah I’ll not tell you his surname.
A:    His surname.
B:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
B:    And he wore a big long mac and great big boots. He was straight off a
      Lowry. Erm [coughs] and he had a most horrible face and sometimes you
      could walk down towards [anon]-
I:    Mm.
B:    and you’d see him on the aquaduct. You could- his image was there. So
      y- you now had to decide did you wait for your mate before you went
      over the bridge to go to church-
A:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
B:    or did you just wait ‘til he was looking the other way and run like
      hell.
I:    [laugh]
B:    Well that’s how we coped with paedophilia in those days. Just
      avoiding [anon] [laugh]
A:    I know.
I:    [laugh]
A:    I never got that close to him. I don’t re-
B:    Oh [laugh].
A:    I don’t remember what he looked like [laugh].
B:    Oh I- I go-
A:    I think he was just a legend when I went to-
TIME [16:00]
A:    when I got to [anon].
B:    I got too close to his brother one day erm- there was a guy who was
      in our year at grammar school [anon]. Do you remember [anon]?
A:    Yeah yeah.
B:    Oh he lived near [anon] and he had a mad brother. And if people used
      to hang about outside their house he’d open the window [knock] and he
      used to have a jerry under the bed.
I:    [laugh]
B:    A wee pot or whatever [laugh]. And he used to empty it.
I:    [laugh] oh no.
B:    So- over whoever was standing outside his house.
I:    [laugh].
B:    Aye that was [anon].
A:    Mm.
B:    But we were lucky where we lived [anon] because there were lots of
      fields nearby.
I:    Yeah.
B:    Erm [anon] didn’t exist and you were soon going toward [anon]
I:    mm
B:    and round there there were lots and lots of fields where you could
      just enjoy yourself and-
I:    Yeah.
TIME [17:00]
B:    go home with jam jars full of newts and tadpoles and erm-
A:    Tha- that’s right and there was-
I:    [laugh]
A:    and there was no traffic on the roads. There was-
B:    No.
A:    there were very few cars so you- you- there was danger of crossing
      main roads and- mm-
B:    No you could go on your bike anywhere.
A:    Yeah.
B:    I mean regular bike trips were-
A:    Mm.
B:    places like Lymm, Pickmere.
A:    Mm.
B:    And if you were really fit Chester or Southport.
A:    Southport even.
I:    Really?
A:    Mm.
B:    Mind you I did Chester once and I was so tired when I got there.
I:    [laugh] not surprised.
B:    Had my- had my sandwiches bottle of pop., and I said ‘we’d better get
      off’ [laugh].
I:    [laugh]
B:    ‘If I stay much longer I’ll fall asleep [laugh] and I’ll never get
      home’. Ah- it seems to take forever in a car now.
A:    It does-
I:    Mm.
A:    It takes- it seems to take longer in a car than it used to on the
      bike.
B:    It’s- so does Southport.
A:    I’m sure. Used to- we always used to reckon Southport was thirty
      miles but-
TIME [18:00]
A:    I’m sure it’s- it- it’s the road system. Must be the road system
      these days it’s- it’s nearer forty-
I:    Mm.
A:    you know.
I:    Yeah.
A:    I noticed one of the questions here says did you ever get hurlt- hurt
      whilst playing when you were a kid? I remember breaking my arm once.
I:    Oh.
A:    We used to have- in our garden we used to have a- a six foot wall at
      the back. Drop down. And we used to swing on a s- on a washing line-
I:    [laugh]
A:    out and drop into the garden.
I:    Yeah.
A:    And my f- ankle got tangled up in the rope.
I:    Oh no.
A:    So I swung out and my ankle stayed where it was-
B:    Oh.
I:    Ah.
A:    and I went down and I broke my arm. That’s erm- I’ve only had three
      breaks in my life and that was the first one. [inc]
B:    I’ve- I’ve never had a break.
A:    Haven’t you?
B:    No.
I:    Yeah.
A:    Yeah.
B:    Mind you I’ve never played rugby and you have.
TIME [19:00]
A:    My only- I’ve only had one break playing rugby and that was this erm
      metatarsal but erm I broke my ankle playing soccer-
B:    Oh.
A:    when I was about eighteen, (1.5) seventeen perhaps. Mm.
B:    Yeah the only visit I had to erm casualty as we used to call it not
      accident and emergency was when I fell off a swing. Must’ve been about
      nine, ten and there was a little bit of competition going on to see
      who could do the most daring things on the swing.
I:    [laugh]
B:    Like jump off while it was still in the air and not using your hands
      and just s- sticking with it and I got to the back swing and just fell
      off chin first.
I:    [gasp] oh no.
A:    Mm.
TIME [20:00]
B:    Yes it was that scar.
A:    Still got a scar?
I:    Oh yeah.
B:    Yeah.
A:    Yeah.
B:    So I went home. Mum took me to [anon] casualty and the nurse s- said
      ‘Oh well that’s one way to lose a bit of fat isn’t it’
I:    [laugh]
A:    Mm mm.
B:    [laugh] then she just got her scissors out and cut the excess fat off
      and stitched it up.
I:    [laugh]
A:    [inc]
B:    Done and dusted. No local. Erm so that was swinging. Erm- Yeah, the
      only other time in casualty, was erm three years ago when I fell.
      Tripped over [anon]-
A:    Oh aye you did yeah.
B:    [anon] the dog.
I:    Oh.
B:    I nearly lost me thumb and I had to have-
I:    Wow.
B:    they couldn’t count the stitches. Well I couldn’t. I just got fed up
      of trying to keep count. It was all round here as far as there.
I:    Oh yeah.
TIME [21:00]
B:    I was lucky that [anon] was around and erm she wrapped a towel around
      it. Put it in the air.
I:    Mm.
B:    And she drove me to hospital. And it was the first time she’d driven
      that car.
I:    [laugh]
B:    ‘I’ve never driven it before’. But you’ll soon learn.
A:    How are we doing for time [anon]?
I:    Erm twenty one minutes.
B:    Twenty- oh-
A:    Gone.
B:    ne- ne-
I:    [inc]
A:    Shall we mo- shall we move on?
B:    nearly- nearly half term. Yes lets move on.
A:    It’s all about school and we’ve t-
B:    Oh we done-
A:    we’ve touched on school.
B:    touch- touched on school and erm- what have we got there scholarsh-?
A:    Right.
B:    Holdays?
A:    No where did you go to school it says.
B:    Where did you go to school. Oh here right.
A:    That one.
B:    That one
A:    Mm hmm.
I:    Mm hmm.
B:    Well I started at [anon] school.
TIME [22:00]
I:    [laugh]
B:    [anon] for short. Erm [anon] was a victorian philanthropist who did
      things like building hospitals and schools.
I:    Oh ok.
B:    And he built one in [anon] for the erm Church of England children who
      lived in [anon]. There was already a Church of England school there
      attached to the church-
I:    Mm.
B:    called [anon]- [anon] but it was the other side of [anon].
I:    Oh ok.
B:    And very few lived on that side [laugh].
I:    [laugh]
B:    Most of the kids lived on the [anon] side. And that’s probably one
      reason why he sited it where he did in erm- in [anon].
A:    And I should think the bridge was probably closed a lot more in those
      days as well than it is- it is today-
B:    Oh it’s very busy traffic yeah.
A:    cause there was a lot of traffic up and down-
B:    Yeah.
A:    the ship canal-
B:    I bet it was opened and closed every hour.
A:    to the docks.
I:    Mm.
A:    So-
B:    Yeah.
TIME [23:00]
A:    There was a- always queues.
B:    Yeah so-
A:    I remember queues when I first started driving every time I tried to
      cross [anon] bridge.
I:    Really?
A:    Yeah.
B:    Went there from five ‘til- five years ‘til I was ten and then [anon]
      ‘til I was seventeen. Seven years there.
A:    Mm. I started at [anon] school in erm [anon] or [anon] on the border
      I think which was just a- a standard state school. Quite big classes
      in those days about- I think I remember there were forty eight kids in
      the class.
I:    Wow.
A:    Erm and there were- it was quite a big school because there were four
      streams A, B, C, and D in the secondary school and we erm-
TIME [24:00]
A:    tended t- to have just one teacher for all the lessons.
I:    Yeah.
A:    Erm and I remember that starting in the second year at junior school
      and the- the teacher came in- our form teacher and started writing on
      the board in real writing. And none of us had learnt real writing
      before that time-
I:    Really?
A:    so he realised he had to stop and teach us how to do real writing-
I:    [laugh]
A:    before he could teach us anything else.
I:    Gosh.
A:    So that’s- that’s the- the time we learnt it. And then in the fourth
      year we all took our eleven plus t- to g- see if we could go to
      grammar schools.
I:    Mm.
A:    And out of the school- out of the year there were twelve people
      passed their eleven plus.
I:    Wow.
A:    And I was one of them and I went to [anon] grammar school.
TIME [25:00]
B:    [laugh]
A:    And erm touching on one of these questions here. First day at- at
      school at [anon] school. There was an initiation ceremony and between
      two sets of steps and the school there was a like erm a- a- the- the
      bank went down and then there was like a- a gully which was about
      three foot wide and three foot deep. Erm and probably ten yards wide
      at the very most and all the first year kids were thrown into that-
I:    Oh no
B:    [laugh]
A:    on the first day.
I:    [laugh]
A:    So there were probably fifty or sixty kids crammed into this thing.
I:    [laugh]
A:    And if you ever-
TIME [26:00]
A:    if you tried to get out you got thrown back in-
I:    [laugh]
A:    bodily.
B:    Was it that-
A:    And that was called a monkey run.
I:    [laugh]
B:    Was that an all boys school-
A:    No no no no-
B:    or was it mixed?
A:    that was- it was mixed but it was segregated playgrounds of course.
B:    Yeah yeah we had that.
A:    Yeah it was mixed yeah.
B:    Yeah.
A:    Yeah. That erm- so that was-
B:    Yeah w- w- we had it like that.
A:    the monkey run. Everybody in brand new school uniforms-
B:    Yeah.
I:    [laugh]
A:    got thrown in the dirt you know. The first day.
B:    Well I suppose ours was a cleansing our i- initiation ceremony. You
      had your head put in the toilet and the toilet flushed. [laugh]
A:    flushed [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
A:    Mm.
B:    I think a lot of headmasters in those days tried to run their schools
      along public school lines.
A:    Mm.
B:    And erm they must have knew- known these intiation ceremonies were
      going on-
I:    Yeah.
A:    Oh yeah yeah.
B:    and it were just ‘part of school life old chap’.
A:    Mm.
B:    You know [laugh].
A:    Yeah.
TIME [27:00]
B:    Erm cos I presume you had to wear a school cap did you?
A:    We had to wear a school cap at all times on the way to school-
B:    Yeah.
A:    on the way home from school, lunchtimes if you went out. Although you
      weren’t generally allowed out of school unless you were going home for
      lunch.
B:    Yeah then you had to have written permission for that didn’t you.
A:    Yeah yeah. Well I- I once got erm into trouble for going out of
      school at lunchtime. We used- we used- we used-
B:    Well I did. It was when I went out with you to the local café
      [laugh].
I:    [laugh]
A:    Yeah.
B:    [inc]
A:    But this was when I was at [anon]-
B:    Had a quick pepsi and a woodbine [laugh].
I:    [laugh]
A:    We got- we got caned. Two of us went out to buy a bottle of sauce to
      have with our school dinner.
I:    [laugh]
B:    [coughs]
A:    And we were on second sitting and we got caught. Called before the
      headmaster and we got caned for erm going out of school at lunchtime.
I:    Oh no.
B:    [outbreath] what kind of sauce was it?
A:    OK [laugh].
B:    OK [laugh].
I:    [laugh].
TIME [28:00]
A:    Or Daddies I’m not sure. One or the other.
B:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
A:    Yeah yeah [laugh].
B:    Did you have to wear short trousers?
A:    No we- we- we weren’t obliged to wear short trousers. I wore long
      trousers in the first year.
B:    Oh.  We were erm-
A:    But no we could wear long trousers.
B:    third year before we could wear long trousers.
A:    Mm.
B:    In fact-
A:    When I joined [anon] school in the forth year there were still some
      of the lads-
B:    Yeah.
A:    wearing short trousers- [laugh]
B:    [laugh]
I:    really? [laugh]
A:    in the forth year and that would’ve been what age fifteen, sixteen?
B:    Fifteen, sixteen.
A:    Yeah.
B:    Yeah well if the parents still thought  ‘those shorts still fit’-
I:    Yeah [laugh].
B:    I’m not buying you long trousers just bec-
I:    Waste of money. [laugh]
B:    Yeah waste of money.
A:    Mm.
B:    Yes it was erm- the girls wore gym slips in the winter and dresses in
      the summer.
TIME [29:00]
A:    Mm.
B:    Which they don’t seem to do now do they.
I:    No.
B:    No.
A:    That’s right they- that was erm- that was the same at [anon]. The
      girls had a uniform dress for the summer-
B:    Yeah yeah.
A:    for the summer term. And the other two terms they had to wear gym
      slips up to a certain age and then it was skirts and blouses wasn’t it
      after a certain age and ties-
B:    Oh yes after y- about forth year. Yeah.
A:    Yeah. White blouses.
B:    Yeah I’ve- I’ve got one of those old school photographs that’s about
      a yard long-
I:     [laugh]
B:    or two yards long. And you can see all the different uniform styles-
A:    Yeah.
B:    according to their ages on that.
A:    Show that to [anon] actually-
B:    Yeah.
A:    It’s quite interesting-
I:    Mm.
A:    cause I- I think we both-
B:    Did you have them taken in your school?
I:    Yeah.
B:    Yeah [inc] the long ones.
A:    Yeah. I think we’re both on that one aren’t we?
B:    I think we are yeah.
A:    Is that the fifty nine one- fifty eight one?
B:    Fifty eight, fifty nine something like that yeah.
A:    Fifty eight yeah. Yeah.
B:    Yeah. You’re on the back row.
A:    I was showing [anon] the other night.
B:    Were you? [laugh].
I:    [laugh]
A:    Yeah came across it. Yeah.
TIME [30:00]
A:    Mm.
B:    Yes so we both remember our first days at school then.
A:    Yeah.
B:    I- I- my initiation was easy because I knew some of the lads in the
      second year and erm they did me a favour and erm made sure I didn’t
      get too much of a ducking in the toilets [laugh].
A:    Yeah.
I:    [laugh]
B:    They wanted me to play football in their team as well.
I:    [laugh]
B:    I spent my life-
A:    I’ve-
B:    school life being favoured [coughs] and because I had a certain
      amount of what most people thought was a little bit of talent at
      football.
I:    Mm.
B:    And erm it was misguided. This lad, cricket I was selected for the
      school cricket team. And I was still in shorts and it was ridiculous
      going out to play cricket in shorts.
TIME [31:00]
B:    So my mum had to take me to the co-op in Eccles to buy me some white
      long trousers [laugh] to play cricket.
I:    [laugh]
B:    And I never got a bat or a bowl. I must’ve been a pretty good fielder
      [laugh].
I:    [laugh]
A:    Mm. We used to erm- well we both played for the same under fifteens-
B:    Oh yeah yeah.
A:    football team. [anon] was captain who we still see occassionally.
B:    Mm.
I:    Mm.
A:    And erm Barney [anon] was vice captain and I’d just joined the school
      in the fourth year. And played in one or two games classes and they
      picked me to play on the under fifteens team.
I:    Right.
A:    So we’ve got a photograph of that somewhere.
B:    We have. Yeah.
I:    Was the team good?
A:    We played in- and then we played e- for the school team didn’t we the
      following year.
B:    Yeah yeah.
A:    And the erm- the full team. But we were both quite keen on erm
      athletics and- and sports as well.
B:    Yeah.
A:    I never played cricket very much but erm-

I:    [laugh].
A:    He’d been bragging the year before-
TIME [33:00]
A:    that he was gonna win it.
I:    Oh [laugh].
B:    what was the leading girl called? If the leading man was Rex or
      Victor- Victor Ludorum wasn’t it- the erm the men or the-

A:    that would stay no Ludorum.
B:    W- Ludorum would be the same.
A:    Th- that would- that wouldn’t- that wouldn’t be sexed.
B:    You don’t change it like in French from petit to petite.
A:    No it’s- that- that Ludorum means ‘of the games’ doesn’t it?
B:    Yeah.
I:    Mm.
A:    So it could’ve been erm-
B:    Yeah Victoria Ludorum [laugh].
A:    Vict- could’ve been Victris or some- Victrix.
I:    [laugh]
TIME [34:00]
A:    Victrix or something like that I suppose.
B:    Yeah.
A:    Anyway.

A:    Yeah. And then he went off to university so we split up then.
I:    Oh right.
B:    Yeah erm-
A:    Mm.
B:    and him and the lead guitarist and the drummer they prefered to buy
      cars and motorbikes and things instead of amplification.
I:    Mm.
TIME [37:00]
B:    Erm-
A:    But we didn’t- no- not- no-
B:    but we’d have- we wouldn’t have been able- w- we had amplification of
      such.
A:    As such- yeah. Of a sort.
B:    We had microphones sellotaped-
I:    Yeah.
B:    to the back of our guitars.
I:    [laugh]
B:    leading into reel to reel tape recorders.
I:    Wow.
B:    So it was really not loud at all [laugh]

A:    Mm. Oh it w- it was a treat to have played at a venue where they had
      a microphone wasn’t it-
B:    Oh aye they had their own PA system.
A:    because quite a few of them didn’t.
I:    Really?
A:    So there were no mic- no amplification in some of them.
I:    No.
A:    The school had a- a microphone didn’t they.
B:    Yeah.

B:    Yeah and Urmston baths.
A:    Mm. Mm.
B:    Urmston baths is- do you remember when it was the erm circular one?
I:    Is that when it was the Curzon?
B:    Opposite the Curzon.
I:    Mm. I- my dad’s told me about it.
B:    Yeah, well they used to have dances there.
I:    Oh ok.
B:    They used to put boards over the- the pool
TIME [38:00]
B:    and we played there once at Urmston and Flixton junior football
      league’s presentation evening.
I:    Oh ok.
B:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
A:    [laugh]
B:    We sounded good with the echoes and-
A:    Oh yeah yeah the echoes.
I:    [laugh]
B:    the water and-
A:    Mm.
B:    the roof top. And it was a complete dome at the top made out of glass
      and one year I think it was s- let me see [anon] was about six or
      seven. It’d have been about nineteen eighty. We had in- tremendous
      hale stones. Bigger than golf balls.
I:    Wow.
B:    And they went right through the roof of Urmston baths.
I:    Oh.
B:    And of course all the glass followed and all the tiles were damaged
      and-
TIME [39:00]
B:    the council said it’s erm not economical to repair. So they knocked
      it down.
I:    Oh is that why?
B:    Yeah-
I:    Oh I didn’t know that.
B:    and it was a magnificent building. Th-
I:    I’ve seen a picture of- mm.
B:    they had diving boards and erm nice café sauna. Did you ever go? Erm-
A:    I think I probably just went the odd time.
B:    Yeah.
A:    But I used to [anon] when I was younger and we used to go from
      school. We were taught to swim from school went to [anon].
B:    Yeah we went to [anon]-
A:    And erm-
B:    from junior school.
A:    Yeah-
B:    But at grammar school there was no swimming at all was there.
A:    that was- that was quite- and  [anon]. I- I went to [anon] a few
      times. I lot of my youth I spent in the scouts and the sea scouts
      based at [anon] from being about thirteen year old-
I:    Mm.
B:    [coughs]
A:    up to it was probably about twenty six when I packed it in altogether
      [laugh].
TIME [40:00]
B:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
A:    What we used to do spend a load of time goin away camping and-
I:    Oh yeah.
A:    Yeah. But erm-
B:    Well my grandad wouldn’t allow me to go in the scouts. He didn’t
      believe in it.
I:    Really?
A:    Oh.
B:    And grandad’s word was gospel.
A:    Mm.
B:    He said it’s like Hitler youth.
A:    [laugh]
I:    Mm.
B:    He thought it was an army for kids.
A:    Mm.
B:    But being [anon] he wanted to be very, very English and tow the line.
      So Sundays we weren’t allowed to play out. We were not forced but
      highly encouraged to go to church.
I:    Yeah.
B:    So eventually I joined the church choir at about the age of seven or
      eight. So that meant you soon got promotion cos there weren’t many
      boys in the choir. I think there were four of us. You soon got
      promotion to alter boy.
I:    Yeah.
TIME [41:00]
B:    And then after confirmation you had to go to the early morning mass.
      You took it in turns at going to eight o’clock or nine o’clock. Then
      you were singing at eleven o’clock mattins. You had to go to Sunday
      school at two o’clock [laugh].
I:    [laugh]
B:    And then six thirty evensong.
I:    Busy day [laugh].
B:    So busy day. So you didn’t have- really have time to play out on a
      Sunday.
I:    [laugh]
A:    Mm.
B:    Yeah erm.
A:    Well everybody went to Sunday school in those days-
B:    Yeah.
A:    but it was- it was only once for me. There was no choir cos it was a
      little mission church down in [anon].
B:    Ah. Well the- the- the choir was the undoing of the church in many
      ways. Because we got a little bit beyond our station. We started
      singing very high brow stuff like-
A:    Mm mm.
B:    Handel’s Messiah and-
I:    Mm.
B:    we had to have erm choral communion every first Sunday in the month.
TIME [42:00]
B:    And the congregation got a bit fed up with it.
I:    Oh ok.
B:    Cause it wasn’t the sort of stuff where you could join in the chorus

B:    And the erm th- the vicar wasn’t very dynamic and his wife was always
