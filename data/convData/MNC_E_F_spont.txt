      ditches where all the water drains in-
I:    Yeah.

      said ‘a butterfly’ He said erm, ‘let it go! You don’t know what it’s
      like t- to be fastened up’.
F:    mm, mm
TIME [07:00]
E:    So I did and erm I went to the other farm and walking back I went to
      have a lookayin this ditch. And I found erm clothes, prison clothes
      [laugh]. It was an escaped prisoner. [laugh]

E:    But this is a modern house now and there was an old house on there.
I:    mm
E:    And I didn’t know when I bought this house exactly where I’d lived.

      anything.
I:    Really?
E:    Your parents. They kept s- [inc] secret.
I:    mm
E:    I erm- when I was five I went to my Grandma’s funeral in [anon].
I:    Yeah.
E:    And you weren’t allowed to see anything so I- I was taken for a walk
      in the village. It was a lovely village. There was a stream and it was
      a beautiful village and I was only five. And all me life I had this
      picture of this village and whenever I asked my parents what it was
      called ‘what do you want to know for?’ And I must’ve been about
      seventy and we had a motorhome then.

TIME [10:00]
E:    And I said to my wife ‘come on. I’m going to find-
I:    Yeah.
E:    the name of this village’. I knew where one of the ancestors lived
      and we went into this erm village and they said ‘oh you’d better ask
      at the postoffice he’ll know’. So we went in the postoffice, says ‘I
      can’t help you. I’ve only been here two weeks’.
I:    Oh [laugh]
E:    So he didn’t know any of the villagers. So an- anyway in the end we
      did find a person of the surname that we were looking for. So we went
      round to this house and as we- and I said to me wife ‘get out and ask
      this lady walking down the path if they know a [anon]’. So she got out
      and this lady says ‘come on in it’s me mother’.
I:    Really?
F:    mm, oh
E:    Yeah. And she told me the name of the village. So after about seventy
      years I went back and it still looked the same to me.
I:    Really?
E:    But they had secrets they wouldn’t tell you.
I:    mm
F:    mm
E:    ‘W- what do you want to know for?’ And erm-

E:    So I- I was at school when the war started and erm it was a queer
      time because all the street signs were moved. All the lights were
      taken awa- no lights were allowed to be on.
I:    Mm.
E:    All the cars had to have a light with a slit in it only.

F:    Mm.
E:    They were taken away and- and where I lived in [anon] there was a
      barrage balloon site on the corner. And the barrage balloon was- it
      was f- f- filled with gas and when the airraid came it used to go into
      the air to stop aircraft d- diving down.
I:    Oh, okay.
E:    Because we lived a short distance from [anon]-
I:    Yeah, mm
E:    which was erm industry in the war.
F:    Mm.

      was windy the ba- the barrage balloon used to sway into our- our back
      garden you know and erm yeah.
I:    did it? [laugh]
F:    [laugh]
E:    [laugh] You just were frightened to death you know and they erm and
      leading to [anon] was big oil drums on the side of the road-
I:    Right.
E:    with a [inc] out.
I:    mm
E:    And the Germans used to follow the ship c- canal from L- Liverpool-

      raid  you know.

E:    And you used to f- f- follow the moon
No left channel (Edmund)
E:    up the canal and if the wind was blowing to Trafford Park they used
      to light these oil drums so a mass of smoke went over the park and
      they couldn’t find it.
I:    Oh.
F:    Oh.
E:    Yeah. So erm- I think I’ve lived in the best time cos radio was still
      new. T- television had been thought of but it had been put on one side
      because of the war.
I:    yeah
E:    Buses were always on time.
I:    [laugh] [inc]
E:    Weren’t they Fearne [anon]?

E:    Yeah.
F:    that’s just standing there. I know- I used to go there one time.
E:    Yeah [inc]
F:    But it’s just standing there doing nothing you know. Sh- sh- it’s a
      shame really you know.
E:    They’ve gone because my youth I used to go to the cinema about twice
      a week.
I:    Yeah.
E:    And when I got a little bit older, do you remember Urmston baths?
I:    Not the old one.

      floor and they had dancing every Saturday and Wednesday.
I:    Really?

      week.
I:    Ah.
F:    Mm.
E:    That was fun.
I:    Mm.
E:    And you daren’t drink cos if you’d had a drink a girl wouldn’t dance
      with you.
I:    [laugh]
E:    It was very strict in those days.
TIME [17:00]
E:    So yeah U- Urmston’s v- very busy now. Whereas I can- one- one memory
      I’ve got in the school days when the war started was me mother pushing
      the pram with my sister in-
F:    Mm [laugh].
E:    down to Urmston a blackout c- c- curtaining you know. Cos we had
      orders. We hadn’t got to sh- sh- show any lights at all and-
F:    Yeah.
E:    you had to have your windows blacked out so nobody could see and that
      is one of the memories I’ve got. And then the bombs dropping round
      you. It was a bit of a hectic time wasn’t it.
F:    [inc]
E:    [inc] anxious time.
F:    [inc] those- those days, yeah
E:    You never got a night in bed-

      wouldn’t- you’d be safe inside there you know.
I:    Yeah.
F:    Yeah.
E:    We had a wired mesh all around it like an- animals [laugh] [inc].
F:    [laugh]
E:    And that was called- and that was inside ours. The Anderson shelter.
I:    We had one outside our house.
E:    Did you?
I:    In our old house.
E:    yeah
I:    It had like pebbles over it so it looked like it was just part of the
      ground.
E:    Yeah so it looked like a part of the garden. Yeah.
F:    Oh yeah.
I:    I never- we couldn’t get into it cos it was all blocked off inside.
E:    Mm.
F:    Oh.
I:    But at least I found [inc].
E:    Yeah, yeah. Yeah th- they were scary days weren’t they in a way

      on in Urmston then.

I:    [laugh]
F:    [laugh]
E:    Yeah. I tell you what I was thinking of last night. I knew what I
      wanted to do when I left school and as soon as I was fourteen I was
      out.
I:    Mm.
E:    And I wanted to be a lithographic printer.
F:    Oh yeah.
E:    I was always interested in printing all- this was nineteen forty
      four. There was one year left of the war. But it was ending and there
      were soldiers were arriving home then.
I:    mm
E:    So they had to have their old jobs back.
I:    Right.
E:    You c- I c- could not get a job
I:    mm
E:    to be a lithographic printer. So- I’m talking a lot aren’t I.
I:    [laugh]
F:    No you ca- no you carry on you carry on!
E:    So there was an advert in the newspaper. The evening news.
TIME [21:00]
E:    ‘Boy wanted to learn lithographic printing’ Manchester. So I was
      there for eight o’clock and the job had gone.
I:    Right.
F:    Oh.
E:    Dear me. Anyway so they said ‘but we’ve got a vacancy in the
      handwritten department’. Now don’t ask me what that was.
I:    [laugh]
F:    [laugh]
E:    So they- I went along with them upstairs and they showed me. There
      was about nine men working there all doing handwritten posters-
I:    Oh.
E:    which they did in those days.
I:    Mm.
E:    I mean I can r- r- remember Urmston it was just full of posters on
      the walls. Most of those were hand done.
I:    mm
F:    mm
E:    All- o- others were lithographic printed so I started there. And erm
      to cut a long story short I did that the rest of my life for fifty
      years.
I:    [laugh]
E:    But when I worked there got a pound a week.
F:    A pound.
E:    And I’ve written this down because I’d forget it wouldn’t I [laugh]
TIME [22:00]
I:    [laugh]
F:    [laugh]
I:    You came prepared [laugh].
E:    I had to go on the bus to Manchester six days a week. That cost me
      fifty four d, old p- pence a week. I had to give me m- mother ninety p
      oh no d, of the old money.
I:    Mm.
E:    I used to go to the pictures twice a week for th- th- thirty d.

E:    for a week and that was a pound.
F:    Pound.
E:    And I used to live on it

E:    and I think now. I think that’s now why it’s made me appreciate-
I:    Yeah.
F:    mm
E:    the value of money.
I:    Mm.
E:    And erm if I can jump a bit further I then left there and went to
      work for another firm who did, you won’t have heard of these will you-
TIME [23:00]

      me own business and I started my own business in nineteen sixty six

      weeks holiday pay that I’d got from the firm.
I:    Yeah.
E:    Fifteen- thirty pound it was for two weeks.
I:    Uh huh.
F:    [inc]
E:    Out of that I had to pay sixteen pound to rent the shop. It was a big
      gamble wasn’t it.
I:    Mm.
F:    Yeah.
E:    But I was lucky that I got the c- custom you know.
I:    Yeah.
E:    Struggled and erm- but people were good in those days c- anyway I- I

      he used to bring me the advertising to do you know big wooden signs.
TIME [25:00]
I:    Yeah
E:    And so I hadn’t erm money to buy the wood even to do them on. But
      there was a wonderful sh- shop in [anon] where th- you know they used
      to sell wood.
F:    Mm.
E:    And he said to me ‘Edmund [anon] you take it. When you get paid you
      pay me’ and I thought that was lovely that.
I:    Yeah.
E:    You know. And I worked on my own for t- twenty five years and enjoyed
      it. Erm and I lookayback on life it’s- it’s had its bad times I’ve
      married twice.

      divorced. D- didn’t know where [anon] was. Hadn’t the slightest where

I:    yeah

I:    Yeah.
E:    older people to go out and that’s one of the sad things of life which
      I’ll go back to in a minute that. It’s reminded me of something. Erm

I:    Yeah.
E:    Which is good.
F:    Mm.

      sure that you’re- the dogs are settled.
F:    mm, mm
I:    Yeah.
E:    And we- oh we went to this dog called Honey. And the day before we
      got a phone call from the guide dogs. He says ‘I hope you don’t mind
      he wants to meet you’. I said ‘no I don’t mind’ you know. And erm- so
      we went down and we met him. M- m- my wife sat beside him and
      questions were asked and if it meant just a yes or a- a no answer-
I:    Mm.
E:    my wife had to either t- t- t- tap his hand for yes. I forget which
      way round or-

      picked it up.

E:    So that- but he must’ve gone deaf later in life cos he could still
      talk.
I:    Yeah.
E:    So he could talk to us, anyhow, after half an hour he’d- he’d handed
      over the- the- the lead to my wife. He’d handed over the dog’s
      tablets. He had his other dog there-
I:    Mm.
E:    but he was handing over his eyes and his ears.
I:    Aw.
E:    And after half an hour they said to me ‘Mr Jacobs [anon] will you t-
      t- take the dog’s lead and go’. Well I got outside there and I thought
      I’ve taken his eyes and ears away and I cried my eyes out. [laugh] and
      they had to take me for a cup of tea you know.
I:    Aw [laugh].
E:    It’s- it’s a traumatic situation-

      white collars you know.

      frigging beer. Wha- you know.

      the rest of the time by the fire. And that was a greyhound.

E:    Yeah.
F:    Yeah.
E:    So erm anyway I- I never got round to it because me doggy died and
      then me wife died.

E:    And on your own you can’t look after a dog.
I:    Yeah.
E:    But just going back to life. Fearne [anon] and myself go to church.

TIME [42:00]
F:    So-
E:    Well-
F:    that’s what I’m going to do as well.
E:    I enjoyed ch- church. Really enjoyed it. Been all me life cos I was
      first introduced when I was five.
I:    Really?
E:    With going to a church school.
I:    Mm.
E:    And then a church school. And then I was in the best youth club of
      all which was a church and then I moved away from the church w- when I
      got married first time. Never went back. And I’ve been a very active
      member involved in doing everything.
I:    Yeah.
E:    And enjoyed it. Now I won’t mention any names or where I’m going but
      this vicar doesn’t get the best out of me.
I:    Oh really.
F:    Mm.
E:    Yeah, and it’s sad that.
I:    Yeah.
E:    And he knows it. He’s a nice chap. Great with my wife when she was
      poorly.
I:    Yeah.
F:    Mm.
E:    I mean, [coughs] he said to us m- me daughter ‘any time night or day
      you want me call me’.

      the vicar’.

I:    Really? Aw.
E:    So he- he- he was good on that side.
I:    Yeah.
E:    When you really needed him he was there and I think being a church m-
      member has helped me a lot in life.
F:    Mm.
E:    I- I’m very honest. I’m very sincere. I talk a lot.
