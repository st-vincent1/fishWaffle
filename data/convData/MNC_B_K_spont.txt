I:    [laugh]
K:    [inc] I- I didn’t smoke then but I erm- I worked as a erm motor
      mechanic and the
      lads there, there was quite a lot of them smoked and you couldn’t get
      cigarettes
      because they were under the counter.
I:    Oh.
K:    ‘Would you go and ask your girlfriend’s grandma’ [laugh].
I:    [laugh]
K:    Erm would she let us have some cigarettes. Which she used to like-
B:    Mm, mm
K:    let us have a few packets now and again.
B:    But erm I didn’t have any brothers and sisters.
TIME [02:00]
B:    But there were lots and lots of children.
I:    Mm.
B:    And erm we used to play outside on the erm pavement. There were no
      gardens.
      It was just erm streets in [anon]. And erm we used to chalk the flags
      and
      play hop-scotch and erm play ball against the wall. And erm hide and
      seek in
      peoples’ doors and I have been known to knock on doors and run away.
K:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
B:    And I got a good smack off my mother for doing that because she
      caught me.
      And erm we used to erm- we never went far away from where we lived
      and
      everywhere was very safe. There was no-

 TIME [03:00]
B:    Erm I can remember bread being four pence and milk being four pence
      at the
      same time. And erm she used to have this machine where she cut all
      the bacon
      up by hand with a machine that you turned a handle. And she had loads
      of
      sweets in one window and I was not allowed to touch them-
K:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
B:    unless I asked her could I have some. Now I was allowed but if I was
      caught
      taking any I got another smack off me mother across my legs.
I:    [laugh]
K:    She was a very strict- yeah.
 B:   And it never ever did me any harm. Erm and I did have to help out in
      the house
      because we used to stone the steps. We used to stone the step of the
      shop and
      stone the window ledges of the house-
K:    Mm [inc].
B:    all the way round. And stone the back steps-
K:    The back yard yeah.
B:    with a- a brown stone or a cream stone. And while I was doing it I
      was told to do
      [anon] next door so I had to do those as well.

      football pitch
      [coughs].
B:    Which was horrible surface.
K:    Which was-
I:    Oh was it?
K:    int- in- incidentally- it wasn’t-
B:    It was like cinders.
K:    I was a cinder pitch really. When you fell down it- it used to take
      part of your
      knee cap off.
I:    Ouch.
K:    So constant- [coughs] constantly you had black marks on your knees

      filled with water and we used to go swimming in there. I’d- Many a
      time I’d cut
      my foot, my legs because there was broken bottle-
I:    Oh no.
K:    There was old prams in there.
B:    Terrible when you think of it.
K:    When I think about it [laugh] now.
B:    I mean I wasn’t allowed.
I:    Yeah.
B:    I didn’t know this went on until we started to go out as erm w- when
      I was about
      fifteen or sixteen. Keith [anon] used to mend my bike and I used to
      go for chips
      for all the erm-
K:    All the- all the-
B:    boys and girls that were all round on the corner there.
K:    But erm [inc]
B:    But m- us best or funniest memory was during the war and erm we used
      to go-
      w- we had a back yard and it had a little garden ine itwith a
      beautiful tree in it. The
      erm-

B:    elderflower tree.
K:    Elderflower.
B:    So we did have a bit of a- a little bit of garden but this brick-
      they came and built
      these brick shelters. I can’t remember w- w- how- the shelter being
      built.
TIME [06:00]
B:    But my dad made it very nice inside with beds and we had erm some
      kind of a
      light in there and erm my grandma would never ever come down when the


      air raids went.
K:    Yeah.
B:    And it was very frightening-
I:    Mm.
B:    and it must’ve been very frightening for them but I was only nine,
      ten.
I:    Mm.
B:    And it- to me it was a big adventure.
I:    [laugh]
B:    And one night my dad was a- an ARP warden like you see on erm Dad’s
      Army.
K:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
B:    And erm one night they dropped all these incendiary bombs on this
      pitch at the
      back of our house.
K:    [inc] and they hit erm-
B:    And erm-
K:    the prison.
B:    my dad-
K:    [anon] prison that night.
I:    Oh.
B:    My dad dragged the dustbin out which in those days they were metal
      dustbins.
I:    Mm.
B:    He dragged it outside and he said ‘come on Brenda [anon] and help me
      fill it
      with water because w- we’re going to have to put all these fires
      out’. And I was
      running backwards and forwards and passing him all this water. And
      erm we put
      the light on.
 TIME [07:00]
B:    And I said to him ‘daddy this water’s not going- there’s no water in
      it’. And
      unfortunately in the- so it- to me it’s very funny this.
K:    [laugh]
B:    We were dashing backwards and forwards with this buckets of water and
      there
      was a big hole in the dustbin.
K:    [laugh]
B:    So as fast as we were p-
I:    [gasp], [laugh]
K:    Putting the water in it was running out.
B:    putting the water in [laugh]
I:    Oh no [laugh]
K:    Yeah
B:    So that to me is a- a long- it’s- I mean it’s a long time ago and I
      remember that
      and it was very funny.
I:    [laugh]
B:    And erm when these bombs these incendiary bombs dropped they dropped
      one
      outside a lamp post. You used to have big lamp posts in those days. I
      don’t know
      what- what were those lamp posts erm-
K:    They used to be gas.
B:    Gas.
K:    Gas lit.
I:    Mm.

B:    She’d never ever got up. She used to stay in bed. But she was down
      those stairs. [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
K:    [laugh]
B:    And one night me mother came out and she’d got the budgie on her
      head.
I:    Oh no [laugh].
B:    So she had to t- and I said m- I used to call her mammy ‘mammy’. The-
      I for-
      forget what the bird was called.
 TIME [08:00]
B:    ‘So and so’s on your head’. Sh- She turned quickly back and went you
      know
      went back in the house so that was another funny memory.
I:    [laugh]
B:    And erm- (2.5) about parents-
K:    Erm [coughs] what I used to do was erm when I think about it now I
      would
      never let my sons do that. But erm I used to erm [coughs] when the
      air raids were
      on-
I:    Mm.
K:    [coughs] I used to go out with a- a bucket and a pair of coal tongs
      and I’d be
      picking shrapnel up.
I:    Oh [laugh]
K:    You’d- you’d- you’d be s- listening ye- and you’d hear it going
      ‘shhhhh’
      down the road. And you could see it was white hot. When I think that
      [coughs]
      really that my parents let me go out-
I:    Mm.
K:    picking the sh- the shrapnel-
B:    Mm.
K:    the pieces of shrapnel up. I had buckets and buckets of it.

      got the
      German erm- erm-

I:    Mm.
K: Incendiary bombs had the German mark on.
B:    Mmhmm.
K:    And erm-
B:    But as I say we were children. It was an adventure to us.
I:    Yeah.
K:    Erm I- I th- I thought it was great-
B:    But can you imagine if it happened now. I’d be absolutely-
K:    Yeah.
I:    Mm.
B:    frightened to death.
I:    When you know what’s going on.
B:    You would. It- it would be a very frightening experience cos my
      mother was a
      very nervous lady.
K:    Yeah.
B:    And she must’ve been absolutely frightened to death.
K:    Terrified yeah. But on this football pitch facing they dug it all up
      and put the
      biggest air raid shelter you’ve ever seen on the ground.
I:    Really?
K:    Yeah. And we used to go in there. It- it was terrible. It was t-
B:    Well I never went in.
K:    Oh the- the smell.
B:    My mother wouldn’t go in there so-
K:    But we- we had a-
B:    Mm.
K:    one built in the back erm- the back yard.
B:    Yeah they built these brick-
K:    Brick solid-
B:    They were very strong brick. I meant there were different types of
      shelters.
I:    Mm.

      Morrison and it
      was like a big cage.
K:    A- anderson ones. They-

B:    and flowers. And if the sirens went she used to go under there with
      her husband.
      They had no children. Erm and then there were the Anderson ones with
      people
      in the garden. You used to go down into those.
I:    Mm.
B:    But erm m- there was w- called a blitz. Erm it was a christmas blitz
      wasn’t it?
K:    Yes that was the biggest [coughs].
B:    Nineteen forty- forty one. And my grandparents lived in [anon] which
      is
      in- still in Salford. And when I think of it now they wouldn’t have
      allowed a
      child but I was ten and my mother put me on the bus where we lived-
I:    mm.
B:    to go and see- ‘go and see if your grandma’s alright.’ And I went on
      my own you
      know th-
I:    Mm.
B:    it would be unheard of now wouldn’t it?
I:    Yeah.
B:    And erm when I got there the street had been bombed-
K:    It’d gone.
B:    and all the houses the curtains the windows were all blown out.
I:    Oh.
B:    And I stood at the top of this street and I cried.
I:    Mm.
TIME [11:00]
B:    And this man came to me and he said ‘what’s the matter?’ and I said
      ‘I’ve come
      to see my grandma and look at the house’. He said ‘don’t worry I’ll
      take you’.
      They’ve taken them to th- what they called a rest centre and it was
      in a church.
K:    Church yeah.
B:    And he took me there. Now in this day and age I didn’t know the man.
I:    Mm.
B:    Well you know y-
K:    [coughs]
B:    when you think. Erm there was no-

      lunchtime. We used to go through a- and a park called [anon] Park
      which is still there. Take me back. Then come for me back again in the
      afternoon.
TIME [12:00]
I:    [laugh]
B:    And then I went to [anon] School
K:    [laugh]
B:    and I used to walk there e- but if me mother could afford it I used
      to go on the bus.

      work th- that make the erm moulds in- they made these erm moulds for
      soldiers and cowboys [coughs] and he- he made- he made them out of
      solid lead. When you think now,
TIME [18:00]
K:    I used t- they weren’t painted when- and I got them for Christmas and
      when I think I used to play with lead soldiers [laugh].
I:    Yeah [laugh].
K:    You know which is really harmful for you. But that was the only erm
      toys I had and I had them for years I was playing with those.
B:    My interests when I was a child, I’ve just seen that there, erm was
      music. I learned to play the piano.
I:    Oh.
B:    And erm I- I loved music in any- any form really.
I:    Mm.
B:    And I still do. I still sing and erm we have a music group at church
      but of course that’s- i- that’s lo- current at the moment but me

      my mother’s never been anywhere- no she was born here.
TIME [19:00]
B:    And erm I’ve got a picture of her when she was a little girl. So
      she’d- she was born in nineteen hundred and two so it’s quite and old
      picture [laugh].
I:    [laugh] yeah.
B:    And if you ever want any old pictures I’ve got them.
I:    [laugh]
B:    Erm- erm we didn’t move house at all. Erm we went to live in that
      shop as I say with my grandma and the next move we made was when she
      died and they sold the house, my mother and father, and we went to
      live in [anon]. We were still in Salford and erm Keith [anon] was in
      the army weren’t y- nati- doing his national sh- service.
K:    Yeah.
B:    And erm we married from the house in [anon] didn’t we.
K:    Well I was in the army.
B:    Yes he was in the army.
K:    Because erm- [coughs] erm then [coughs] i- it was a s- sergeant said
      to me- he said- I told him that I was en- engaged-
I:    Mm.
K:    to be married when I came out of the army. He said ‘well really you’d
      be better marrying because you’ll get marriage allowance’.
I:    Oh.
K:    So w- we arranged didn’t we-
B:    Yes-
K:    I’d been in the army about-
TIME [20:00]
B:    and I was twenty one.
K:    Yeah.
B:    And y- Keith [anon] was twenty two when we got married. Mm.
K:    So we did erm get married-
B:    Yeah.
K:    and erm [coughs] and of course Brenda [anon] got the erm- the erm
      marriage allowance and saved it up and we had a nice little nest egg
      didn’t we-
B:    Mm.
K:    when- when I came out.
B:    And that’s when I came up to [anon] from [anon] with a friend who was
      looking at some houses erm on the front there, near [anon].
I:    Mm.
B:    They were building those semis r- just round the corner when you go
      towards the Trafford Centre.
I:    Yeah.
B:    There’s some semis there-
I:    Yeah.
B:    and erm [anon] and she went to look at those and then we came to look
      at these on [anon] and I liked these.
K:    No we- we brought them up didn’t we and y- your father’s-
B:    No, no that was after.
K:    Oh.
B:    That was after. No I brought erm I can’t remember her name now. No
      you weren’t very friendly with her but then-
K:    Mm.
B:    I saw these and went back home and told Keith [anon] and that’s-
      that’s when we came to live in [anon].
I:    In- in th-
TIME [21:00]
B:    In this house in [anon]. Yeah.
K:    Fifty five years ago.
B:    Yeah.
I:    Wow.
B:    Mm.
K:    Yeah.
B:    Mm.
K:    And we- we paid one thousand eight hundred and fifty pounds.
B:    No one thousand six hundred and fifty pounds.
K:    Oh one thousand six hundred and fifty pounds for it.
B:    Sixteen hundred and fifty.
I:    Amazing.
B:    Eh. It’s amazing isn’t it?
I:    Yeah. It is.
B:    But we brought a friend with us who was my son- my eldest son’s
      godfather and they lived in [anon]. And he was a very astute man and a
      very good man and a- we really were very fond of him. And he came with
      us to look at them and my dad was very much against us buying it. He
      said ‘you’ve got a milstone round your neck’. That’s what he said.
K:    But we were very happy living with your parents.
B:    Oh yes-
K:    They had that big house in [anon] and-
B:    we were very, very happy. And erm my mother- and he- my mother
      thought the world of Keith [anon] and he thought the world of her. Erm
      but erm [anon] this friend of ours came to talk me dad round to say
      that he had bought his house and it was three hundred and forty
      pounds.
I:    [laugh]
K:    And that was-
TIME [22:00]
B:    And that was a milstone round their neck but it wasn’t anymore.
I:    No.
B:    And he said eventually it will be beneficial to them. So that’s- he
      talked my dad round and-
K:    Well the thing was you could rent a house then.
B:    Mm.
K:    You could rent houses.
B:    Mm.
K:    There was- there was plenty to rent.
I:    Mm.
K:    I mean not like n- not like today.
B:    But we just liked these houses. We thought they were absolutely
      lovely and erm m- m- what it- what was it we hadn’t got money for? Erm-


K:    Oh the erm-
B:    and my dad lent us the twenty five pounds.
K:    we didn’t have the money for the erm the rest of the money for the
      deposit.
B:    Mm.
K:    It was a hundred pound deposit.
B:    Mm.
K:    We’d paid forty but there was sixty outstanding and w- [laugh] we k-
      kept coming round and having a look and it’s- once they got the roof
      on they wanted the balance.
B:    Mm.
I:    Oh.
K:    And I thought- the came and they’d got the roof on.
B:    And by the Keith [anon] wasn’t a mechanic. He was working for me
      father who was a painter and decorator and you had to have e- eleven
      pounds a week wages. They wouldn’t take the wife then.
I:    Oh.
B:    It was just the husband it-
TIME [23:00]
B:    you know if you were working that didn’t matter.
K:    And I was earning ten pounds.
B:    And he was earning ten and me- my dad said to Keith [anon] ‘well tell
      them you’re earning eleven but I can’t afford to give you that’.
K:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
B:    [laugh] so
K:    And he- he lent us the money for the erm-
B:    Yeah.
K:    the balance.
B:    But when you think of those figures.
K:    Yeah.
I:    I know.
B:    But you see it just- it goes on and on.
I:    Yeah it does.
B:    I meant when- when you get older you’ll think well fancy those prices
      that we paid then.
I:    Yeah.
B:    So erm yeah. Erm in your opinion how has the community changed in
      recent years? Well I think it changed tr- tremendously. Tremendously.
      There’s a lot of terrible things happen now that I don’t think did
      happen then. Children are- are not safe anymore like they used to be.
      And erm-
K:    You can’t afford to take your eyes off them can you.
B:    and everything is so expensive to take them anywhere.
I:    Mm.
TIME [24:00]
B:    I mean my son has just been away with four and he said when you go in
      a- just for a coffee.
K:    [laugh]
B:    It’s six coff- well five coffees or five drinks.
I:    Mm.
B:    And it’s so expensive isn’t it.
I:    Yeah.
B:    But erm everything has- has really gone up in price.
K:    The most important changes have taken place in your town.
B:    Mm well-
K:    Well when we came round here from erm- from [anon] we thought we were
      coming to live in the country-
B:    In the country.
I:    Right.
B:    It was beautiful.
K:    It was so quiet-
B:    Mm.
K:    and erm-
B:    Mm.
K:    You could park anywhere in Urmston and erm- but now I think it’s-
B:    And we liked Urmston as it was.
K:    It- well w- we did yeah.
B:    But I mean now I think they’ve just made a mess of it.
I:    Mm.
B:    [coughs] because it’s part finished and-
I:    Yeah.
B:    and they’re not saying- they’re saying until they- I think they-
      somebody said that they’ve run out of money the developers.
I:    Yeah I think they have.
B:    And erm- so it’s just a mess I think.
TIME [25:00]
I:    I think they expected more people to erm buy those apartments-
B:    I think-
I:    in the centre, but then-
B:    Yeah and they haven’t done. No.
I:    No.
B:    No. No they haven’t. And I think they’re the ugliest looking things.
I:    Yep [laugh]
B:    We only said the other day look at all that horrible wood.
K:    [inc] timber.
I:    Mm.
B:    Where’s the design in that?
I:    I know.
K:    [inc] it’s not-
B:    And then of course a build-up of erm- I’m not objecting to the
      Trafford Centre but the Chill Factor and erm all these big things that
      keep going up. It’s just lost it’s erm I don’t know, prettiness
      really. It used to be a pretty village more or less Davyhulme. And I
      know things have got to progress but I don’t- I hate all these great
      big things that are going up.
I:    Yeah.
B:    And erm I don’t know. Local people-
K:    [coughs] but we remember the first erm-
B:    We remember the-
K:    shopping centre being built in Urmston.
B:    Yeah.
TIME [26:00]
K:    The precinct there.
B:    Yeah.
K:    [coughs]
B:    And it was nice.
K:    It was nice before.
B:    It was a nice precinct that.
K:    It- no it was nice before that they did that I thought.
B:    Mm mm.
K:    It was quite quaint. I’ve s- I’ve got loads of pictures of that.
B:    Mm.
K:    How it used to be [coughs]. But erm-
B:    But I do think there’s a lot of community things happening now like
      erm the man that owns [anon] that [anon].
I:    Yeah.
B:    Now f- I think it’s the third year now that he’s put this community
      erm-
I:    The summer-
B:    sort of a carnival type thing hasn’t he.
I:    Yeah.
B:    In the grammar school gardens and I think- we went because my
      granddaughters were dancing.
I:    Ah.
B:    They go to [anon].
I:    Mm.
B:    And they were doing this dancing group and we went to watch them and
      I just thought it was lovely.
I:    Yeah.
K:    Yes.
B:    All the people- local people all mingling with one another.
I:    Mmhmm
B:    And I really- I r- it really uplifted me to see them all having a
      good time and there was no trouble.
I:    Yeah.
B:    Erm and I think the community spirit here is better and hope it will
      get better.
TIME [27:00]
I:    Mm.
B:    Erm the carnival on Saturday- there’s the carnival on Saturday and
      for the first time there’s erm an ecumenical church tent being
      erected.
I:    Right.
B:    And they’re giving free teas and cakes. In fact we’re involved with
      it.
I:    Mm.
B:    And it’s the first time they’ve done that and erm hope- hopefully
      well they will be telling people all about the things that go on in
      all the churches. Hopefully we might get a few more people to come.
I:    Yeah.
B:    But it’s still a community thing and I think-
K:    Gets people together yeah.
B:     it’s a good thing for the community
I:    Mmhmm
K:    Yeah I li- I-
B:    Yeah and erm there’s not really- when you look at the television and
      see all the horrible things that happen in other towns. I don’t know
      I’ve never heard of anything horrible -
I:    No I haven’t
B:    happening in Urmston at night.
I:    No.
B:    So I just hope that erm- there’s- I think there’s quite a long of
      thing to ha- to do in this community if you’re willing to erm-
TIME [28:00]
B:    you know different erm- erm what- what can I call them, different
      groups. So you needn’t be bored. There’s lots to do really.
I:    Yeah.
B:    If you go out and look for it. (3.0) What’s your- do you agree with
      me? You see-
K:    Yes I d-
B:    we’re very involved in church so I’ve always got something to do.
I:    Mm.
B:    I mean I’m going out tonight. No I’m going out tomorrow and erm going
      out next week all the meetings start so I’ll be out about three nights
      a week which is erm- is very good.
I:    Mm.
K:    Mm. Right [laugh].
K:    (8.0)[inc] erm- erm.
TIME [29:00]
B:    I think it’s very sad that erm TJ Hughes has gone from Stretford.
I:    Yeah.
B:    I think it’ll be a- make a big difference to Stretford erm- erm town
      centre. Erm cos I like- I like that erm shopping precinct. It’s
      pleasant and it’s warm and-
I:    Mm.
B:    erm (2.0) it’s somewhere for people to meet. I don’t know what’s
      going to happen there.
K:    Did you ever get into trouble at school? Going back a bit now aren’t
      I really.
I:    [laugh]
K:    Does it matter?
I:    No of course it doesn’t.
K:    No it doesn’t matter? Yep [coughs].
B:    Did you get into trouble? I didn’t-
K:    Yeah- oh no you didn’t, no.
I:    [laugh]
B:    [laugh]
K:    [coughs]
B:    I was perfect [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
K:    Hey we- we used to c- I went to [anon] School first and from there I
      went to [anon] school, [anon]. And on the way home from when we were
      at erm-
TIME [30:00]
K:    erm [anon] the erm- we used to pass this house that had a cherry tree
      hanging over the wall. And ev- [coughs] everyday you passed it seemed
      to get redder and redder these cherries [coughs] and me and my friends
      one day we thought I think we’ll have some of  those [laugh].
I:    [laugh]
K:    And we climbed on the wall and just pulled a little bunch down and we
      both had one each. And they were horrible.
I:    [laugh] oh no.
K:    But we didn’t- unknown to us there was policeman behind us who
      grabbed us [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
K:    and took us back to school. And erm the next morning we had to come
      out in front of the- all the assembly and the pair of us were brought
      out to the front and- and the teacher erm- the teacher said- the
      Headteacher said I’d have- we’d have to go to his room after and of
      course we were- our heads down [coughs] and we both got the cane on
      both hands. And when we used to walk past that house with those cherry
      trees
TIME [31:00]
K:    we used to have our hands in our pockets [laugh].
I:    [laugh]
B:    Mm.
K:    [coughs]
B:    Yeah well I think there again- I think it’s gone from the sublime to
      the ridiculous.
K:    Yes you’re not allowed to touch-
B:    Because I think it’s digusting now that children have got no respect-


I:    Mm.
B:    for policemen and really a lot of them have not got any respect for
      anybody.
K:    Anybody. No.
B:    And they try and blame everybody bar the parents.
I:    I know. The riots were terrible weren’t they.
K:    Oh that-
B:    Oh that was terrible. Well what’s uplifted me [anon] was the m- the
      all those young people going in and cleaning up.
I:    Yeah.
K:    Yes.
B:    I thought that was wonderful
K:    Yeah. That was brilliant.
B:    And some of them looked- I thought golly you’d-
I:    [laugh] yeah.
B:    You know so you can’t tell by how people look.
I:    No you’re right.
K:    No.
B:    But I do think it’s erm you know that being allowed to throw stones
      at policemen. I was frightened to death of policemen.
K:    Oh yes. Y-
B:    I- that was silly but I’d rather it be like that-
I:    Mm.
B:    than like it is now. I mean policemen are there to erm to keep-
K:    To protect the-
B:    to protect people-
K:    protect the public. Yeah th-
B:    and the public.
TIME [32:00]
B:    And they get a terrible lot of bad pub- publicity.
I:    Yeah.
B:    And I know maybe there are some sadistic policemen but most of them
      are very good and decent men.
I:    Yeah.
B:    And erm I just think it’s awful that children should be taught to
      have more respect.
I:    Mm.
B:    Erm and I still blame the parents for a lot of these children.
I:    Yeah.
K:    Yes it’s sad really. I-
B:    And I think a lot of these children as well are from broken homes and
      they’re living in erm social erm- erm they’re- they’re under the care
      of the erm- Trafford.
I:    Yeah.
B:    And erm I’ve heard reports that they just run wild and you’re not
      allowed to touch them. You’re not- if- they know that if you touch
      them they can report you.
I:    Mm.
B:    And I mean I used to get lots of smacks off my mother and it never
      did me any harm at all. And erm I can always remember when I was- my
      mother had just given me a good hiding and she’d gone into the kitchen
      and I walked behind her and pulled my tongue out.
TIME [33:00]
I:    [laugh]
B:    And she turned round and I got another one.
I:    [laugh] oh no.
B:    And I said ‘what was that for?’ ‘because’ she said ‘you’ve just
      pulled your tongue out haven’t you?’.  And years after I said ‘how did
      you know?’. She said ‘I just knew you were going to do that’.
I:    [laugh]
K:    [laugh]
B:    But we end- we were always the best of friends.
I:    Mm
B:    Really good pals.
[door bell rings]
I:    Erm I can stop that- this now if-
