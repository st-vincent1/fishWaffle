      hospital you was born at home though, weren’t you?

N:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
M:    no it’s completely- I mean it-
TIME [03.00]
M:    it’s absolutely completely different now I mean, it- it’s like when
      you and [anon] were little wasn't so very different but I think
      computers have made a huge difference to the kids
N:    mm, yeah
M:    I mean cos [anon] now at thirteen I mean
N:    yeah, it’s just that-
M:    that- that’s-
N:    that’s me half brother, it’s just Xbox, Xbox, Xbox twenty-four seven
M:    yeah that’s really so- that’s all- everything else is just boring
      isn't it you know
N:    yeah, yeah [laugh]
M:    and er he is- he’s sheltered as well because he’s- he’s the only
      child with his mum
N:    mm
M:    mm and er
N:    and they live down in [anon] don't they
M:    yeah
N:    cos she moved for work so,
M:    and his nana when he comes staying up here, she only ever had two
      girls so
N:    yeah
M:    she’s scared of anything that a boy would do isn't she- she can
N:    yeah boys do yeah
M:    yeah, [laugh]
N:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
M:    ‘oh you can't do that’ [imitation]
N:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
M:    ‘come and dress you doll in front of the Xbox’ [imitation] [laugh]
      you know
N:    yeah, I think that’s why she had that rag-doll sat on the sofa
M:    [laugh] yeah
N:    in the hope that he’d get into that
M:    yeah, yeah and then I go up with a gun
N:    mm
M:    [laugh]
N:    er it is- even I notice it now though like from when I was little
      like just speaking to [anon] now he’s getting to like thirteen it’s
      like-
TIME [04.00]
N:    it is difficult to talk to kids now isn't it?
M:    yeah
N:    it’s- unless you know about computers and you’re- you’re into like
      the games and everything it’s like, my boyfriend [anon] he’s like into
      computers but he’s Playstation three, and me brother’s Xbox and it’s
      like, you know they’re totally different things both thinks one’s
      better than the other and
M:    yeah
N:    it’s just- it’s crazy isn't it, they just like-
M:    yeah
N:    you’ll sit there and it’s like- just like playing like with a console
      isn't it just thumbs and staring at the TV and
M:    well I- I try- I try to introduce him to things that
N:    nothing else- they could be
M:    you do outside the house the kind of things I did when I was a kid
      that
N:    mm
M:    you know like, catapults you know
N:    mm yeah [laugh]
M:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
M:    and then the air rifle and what have you, you know and-
N:    yeah
M:    and just try- just trying to get him outside the house is a struggle
      because it’s- it’s like-     it was like when we went to that scooter
      do last week, wasn't it?
N:    yeah
M:    we were there I mean the vintage scooters and- and it was really good
      cos these are like me cousin runs this [anon] scooter club

M:    yeah, yeah he’s at- he’s at erm Center Parcs isn’t he, this weekend
      with his mates yeah
N:    I think- yeah, we’ll have to find a car one though cos [anon]- I
      think [anon] was saying he’d have been more interested in the cars,
      didn't he?
M:    well you- you don’t know do you
N:    mm
M:    I mean I- you see a car with him and you say ‘do you- do you- do you
      like that?’, ‘it’s alright’
N:    [laugh]
M:    you know, I- I don’t know whether it’s just that- that thirteen year
      old grunting stage that he’s at you know that-
N:    yeah, yeah
I:    [laugh]
N:    [laugh] cos he was, cos we were like when we went to the shop
      beforehand and he said ‘do you want anything’ he’s like,
TIME [09.00]
N:    ‘oh yeah, I’ll have a can of Doctor Pepper’ and I thought, ‘well,
      we’re going to get there in a minute and have a drink anyway but’ so
      he went in and then he was sat there like dead quiet in the front and
      me and [anon] were talking in the back and I thought,  ‘better say
      something’ like you know, so I just said to him ‘so what have you been
      up to this week [anon]?’, ‘XBox mainly’
M:    yeah
N:    I was like ‘mm, okay’  [laugh], ‘any good games?’
M:    yeah Guitar Hero
N:    yeah oh god I know what ch- that was hard
M:    yeah well I- I can't see the point of it
N:    oh no I d- cos that’s what [anon] said to him he said ‘is there like
      a free mode, you know where you could like sort of do your own track?’
      and he said ‘no’ so
M:    yeah, well he has- he has a guitar at home and I don’t know, and
      apparently I mean I’ve- I’ve heard him once but, he’s er, not too
      happy about letting me know about it that he- he plays the keyboard as
      well but he doesn’t read music, he just picks it up by ear
N:    and he just makes stuff up
M:    yeah
N:    yeah, well that’s good
M:    erm but I can’t see the point of this- this Guitar Hero if you can’t
      actually make a tune yourself
N:    yeah
M:    you might as well just spend that time learning to play the guitar
N:    yeah, that’s it yeah, cos it’s just-
TIME [10.00]
M:    you know instead of playing somebody else's tracks by pushing buttons
N:    yeah and that- well that’s what [anon] was saying as well cos he said
      you’re not really learning the song, are you,
M:    you’re not- you-re not learning anything
N:    even though you are playing along to that song
M:    yeah you’re just learning a sequence
N:    yeah
M:    but the sequence does not relate to a real guitar so it’s not
N:    yeah
M:    it’s pointless it’s-
N:    yeah, it’s like the- you can get like the drums with it can't you,
      and then
M:    yeah
N:    they have like the headset so you can sing along to it as well can
      you imagine that you have to ac- I’ve watched like [anon] and her- her
      boyfriend and his mate do it, and you have to like it- it records your
      notes so you have to like get- hit the high note if you don’t you like
      fail the challenge and-
M:    I bet it sounds awful, I bet it’s worse than karaoke
N:    oh no, he’s not a good singer his mate, her boyfriend won’t even try
      he just plays the guitar
M:    yeah, at least karaoke’s acceptable because you’re mainly drunk
N:    eh
M:    you know so that’s
N:    yeah that’s true [laugh]
M:    [laugh] that’s alright, you know but when you’re sober and you hear
      somebody
N:    oh I- I don’t know
M:    screeching at the top of their voice you know I-
N:    yeah, well there was a couple when we went to Spain there was a few
      die hard,
TIME [11.00]
N:    karaoke singers weren't they, that weren’t drunk that get up
M:    oh yeah, yeah
N:    and do the same song every night [laugh]
M:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
N:    there was that old guy that used to sing that song, that- oh god I
      can’t remember what it was now
M:    oh I know, and that- that
N:    ‘Don't Close Your Eyes’ or something like that
M:    oh, all I remember is that one that kept getting all bloody Elvis
      songs and thought he was fantastic and he was terrible
N:    mm, yeah
M:    he didn’t even drink but he had a list of Elvis songs that he wanted
      to sing [laugh]
N:    [laugh]
M:    ah never seen anything like that
N:    and then what was the ones that they always used to sing, he used to
      sing the lad that owned the bar you know to warm everyone up
M:    I don’t know, I can’t remember no
N:    I can’t remember what it was now
M:    I’m getting old you know, I’m getting senile and
N:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
M:    I’m losing it, me memory goes
N:    yeah (0.5) s- g- I got dragged up I hate karaoke I don’t mind
      laughing at everyone else, but I hate doing it and you made me get up

M:    I don’t mind making a fool of myself but what I hate about mobile-
N:    yeah
TIME [12.00]

      have to watch it tomorrow
N:    and the whole world can see it, yeah the whole world can see it on
      Youtube
M:    you know I mean when- when I was younger you made a fool of yourself
      when you got drunk, and you just walked sheepishly into the room the
      next day and you know and- and hoped that nobody was going to say
      anything now you walk in
N:    no one remembered
M:    ‘look at you, you prat’ [laugh]
N:    [laugh] yeah but I didn’t film it though, I’ve not got it, it was- oh
      yeah I did have it
N:    but I think I lost it on the computer
M:    wasn’t it that lad- didn’t that lad film it?
N:    yeah that Irish lad yeah
M:    yeah
N:    cos that- that’s I had to get up and sing the Greece Megamix with
      this lad I’d never met
M:    [laugh]
N:    we’d like literally- he’d walked into the bar and I think his
      granddad had a place over there or something, and he just sat down cos
      we were on the table nearest the door
M:    no he- he actually he came in and he sang that song didn't he, he
      came in and he sang that song and I- I was at the bar and I was
      talking to him when he came over
N:    yeah
I:    [cough]
M:    and I says ‘when I used to live out here’
N:    mm
M:    I said ‘they had a- they had a term, for your kind of singing’
N:    [laugh]
M:    I said ‘it’s not shite, it’s worse than shite’ [laugh]
N:    [laugh]
M:    and he’s looked at me [laugh] and then he came over and bought us a
      drink
TIME [13.00]
N:    yeah, yeah and then he was sat with us weren't he for the night and
      then we had to get up in the end and sing with him

N:    and what was the other one we did, ‘Midnight Train to Georgia’ was
      it? Oh no ‘Leaving on a Jet Plane’

      was only me and me dad that knew it and he didn’t know and he was just
      like filling little bits in you know in the back he’d be like
M:    yeah
N:    ‘ah’
M:    [laugh]
N:    like in the back as we were singing when he didn’t even know the
      words [laugh], it’s quite funny but
M:    mm
N:    but we- it was really late on when we got up though wasn't it
M:    yeah

      doing the house up, and
N:    yeah

N:    yeah he had like this inflatable boat, but he-
M:    he wouldn't go in the water would he?
N:    wouldn't go in the water cos his legs would go through the holes and
      into the water, so he wouldn't go in it so he used to just sit at the
      side [laugh] of the pool in this thing with his trunks and his
      armbands on [laugh]

      you'd taken your book, and you was only about three and she came up to
      me and she says ‘can Natalie [anon] read?’, so I said ‘no, no, she
      can't read’
N:    [laugh]
M:    she says ‘ but she's sat there with the book. She’s turning the pages
      at exactly the right time’
N:    [laugh]
M:    I said ‘that's her absolute favourite book’ I said ‘that's the only
      book she wanted to bring with her’
N:    [laugh]
M:    I said ‘she knows every single line in that book. Every single word’
      and I said ‘the bad part about that is, is when I have to read it to
      her every night before she goes to sleep, I can't skip a page’
N:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
M:    ‘cos she’ll say, ‘well you’ve missed a bit there, you know, that's
      not next that dad’.’ you know [laugh]

      home.

M:    and then she says that she's having a fancy dress for the kids.
M:    I thought ‘oh God, what- what are we going to do on the last day?’
      cos everything’s packed, and you know what your mum’s like, she'd
      listed everything again so

      trees strung them all together and made you a little grass skirt.

      remember liking that book (0.5) mm
M:    but that- but you wouldn’t go anywhere without that book
N:    [laugh]
M:    you really- and then
N:    wait, I bet- I doubt [anon] had a favourite book
M:    no, [anon] wasn’t a reader
N:    cos [anon]- me brother doesn’t like reading
M:    no
N:    at all
M:    no
N:    I’ve always had loads and loads of books, and he’s just into
      computers (0.5) wrestling

M:    he loves his car now, but he was- he always loved Maths [anon],
      didn’t he, [inc]?
N:    yeah, he was better at Maths
M:    yeah
N:    and I was always better at the English and the History side of
      everything, the writing, and- but he hates that so it’s like, if he
      ever applies for a job it’s like, ‘Natalie [anon], can you come and do
      the big question for me on the application form?’
M:    has he asked you for this one yet?
N:    no, I d-
M:    no
N:    I’ve already done it for him last time,
M:    oh
N:    when he applied, so he’s used the same one [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
M:    I remember that time he had- was going to his parents evening and
      they- was it the History teacher or something had- had pulled a fist
      at him or something, he was messing about in class (0.5) not remember
      that?
N:    no
TIME [20.00]
M:    and he said to me- i- it wasn’t long before he left, and- and he said
      to me before we went, before me and your Mum went, and he said erm,
      ‘will you have a word with the history teacher Dad’, so I said, ‘yeah,
      why? What’s wrong?’, ‘it’s only he pulled a fa- erm, he pulled a fist
      at me in class’, I says, ‘why? What were you doing?’ he says, ‘oh, we
      was only messing about’
N:    mm
M:    so I said, ‘you’re lucky,’ I said, ‘cos when I was at school, they
      wouldn’t have pulled a fist at you, they’d have used it’
N:    you’d have got one, yeah
M:    you know, you’d have got a board duster on your head or a piece of
      chalk straight between the eyes
I:    [laugh]
N:    yeah
M:    you know, but- and- and when I went up to the school and saw the
      History teacher, I said, ‘I believe you’ve had a bit of trouble with
      [anon]’ he says, ‘oh yeah,’ he said, ‘i- it was nothing really’ he
      said, ‘I got a bit frustrated’, I says, ‘well listen,’ I says, ‘you’ve
      got my backing,’ I said, ‘if he’s out of hand’, I said, ‘if it was up
      to me,’
N:    yeah
M:    ‘you could take him out and cane him, the way I had when I was at
      school’
N:    yeah [laugh]
M:    you know, cos it never did me any harm
N:    yeah,
M:    and all of this molly-coddling
N:    well that’s it cos they’re too cheeky now aren’t they
M:    yeah
N:    cos they know they can get away with it, cos they can’t do anything,
      but like give them detention or give them lines or something like that


M:    but, I remember being at school, I was what, must’ve been twelve
      years old, so it would’ve been the first year in [anon]

      of everybody
I:    [gasp]
N:    [gasp]
M:    ‘stop messing around!’, and you’re just left there, ringing
N:    [laugh]
M:    you know, and it’s just, [laugh] ‘what’s happened?’, no, but you
      don’t go home and tell your Mum or Dad that it’s happened because
      you’d get another one, you know
N:    yeah
M:    ‘you should behave’
N:    for being naughty
M:    yeah
N:    [laugh] (1.0) crazy, isn’t it
M:    well we had that- that one teacher and erm, we used to have to give
      school fund every week, used to have to g- I think it was five pence
      or something like that
N:    mm
M:    and it was supposed to- with it being a catholic school it was
      supposed to be-
N:    is that like, before they used to do things like, Saint Joseph’s
      penny and all that stuff
M:    oh God, they always did that,
N:    oh, they’ve always had that

      home and

N:    the tea- you had a teacher
M:    oh that teacher, yeah and he- and he was our- our sports teacher
      (0.5) and this- this is how things have changed, now this- this
      teacher would’ve got arrested these days for what he used to do to us,


N:    mm
M:    I mean, you’re like twelve, thirteen years old, and you’re going
      through that puberty stage, yeah, and- and when you come out of gym
      nobody- nobody wants to- you’ve gotta go for a shower, but nobody
      wants to strip off
N:    yeah, yeah
M:    you know, and he used to make everybody strip off, nobody could go in
      in the shorts or anything like that like everybody tried to do, but
      he’d- he’d come in the shower himself, with a wet towel, and he’d be
      hitting you with the towel and
N:    [gasp]
M:    honestly, he’d be hitting you with the towel, but then, talk about a
      bit on the pervy side really, the- you know the foot shower
N:    yeah
M:    he’d- each week he’d choose one kid to wash his feet (1.5) honestly
N:    God
M:    you know, and this- this was a Catholic school and this was our gym
      teacher
N:    yeah
M:    but the- the- the same guy was erm, our form teacher for one year,
      and if you didn’t bring in school fund or if you got in trouble in his
      class
N:    mm
M:    he had a dice (0.5) and he’d roll the dice
TIME [23.00]
M:    and whatever it landed on, that was how many canes you got
N:    [gasp]
M:    and if it landed on six you got a chance to roll it again [laugh]
N:    [laugh] so you definitely got them
M:    yeah, you definitely got some but it was-
N:    it was just whether you were gonna get one or five
M:    yeah, yeah
N:    yeah [laugh] (1.5) God it’s ment- now they’d just-
M:    but if six came up again, you got a six
N:    oh right
M:    yeah
N:    cos now you’d just get lines, I was actually reading something on
      facebook the other day, all about [anon], you know, and about the
      teachers where people like coming on an reminiscing and they’re like
      posting on there and stuff, and there was one guy [anon], that used to
      do the IT, and I thought he was alright but they all used to take the
      mickey out of him and he had like a squeaky voice and he had like this
      massive big boil on his head
M:    [laugh]
N:    and like, he was just a little bit, you know, a bit sweaty and, just
      one of them, and they all used to call him [anon]
M:    [laugh]
N:    [laugh] but he- he actually got sacked and I think all he actually
      did was, somebody was like-
M:    shout at somebody [laugh]
N:    yeah, he shouted at someone, and someone was being disruptive and it
      was on- I think it was only like the-
TIME [24.00]
N:    he was there for the first year I think I was there, so I would’ve
      only been like, what, twelve, and then after the second- the second
      year he never came back and from what I- I gather he just like
      literally, asked someone to leave and they were messing about and
      wouldn’t go out, and he just pushed them outside the door, and that
      was it, he was gone
M:    God
N:    just for like, forcefully removing somebody from the class
M:    [exhales]
N:    and cos we- none of us knew like why he’d left and they were all like
      sort of talking about it on there and, there used to be this other guy
      as well, erm, the D-T teacher, [anon], and erm, they all used to take
      the mickey out of him cos he used to like, wear dead tight pants, and
      he used to stand like an action man, but he was only like five foot
      four or something
M:    [laugh] dead tight pants and a camel toe [laugh]
N:    yeah, yeah, and they used to call him like- he used to call all the
      lads, ‘listen, sonny jim’
M:    yeah, ‘when I was a lad’
N:    like, you know when he was talking to them, yeah
M:    ‘when I was a lad’ so
N:    but he- apparently he- they were saying on there we never- I didn’t
      know that, but his brother was at- famous, he was an actor,
TIME [25.00]
N:    in some like TV programme, I can’t remember what he was in now but,
      he turned into like, a bit of a disgrace like, his brother, and
      apparently like he never you know, wanted to talk about him, and he
      didn’t really have anything to do with him, or anything, and it’s-
      they were like all talking about it on there, so then there was like
      [anon], our DT teacher, he was mental, he used to like, this [anon]
      guy, and like he- he’d like deliberately say people’s names wrong,
      just to wind them up, so like my n- my mate, her name was [anon], and
      when he used to read the register out, he used to just read out [anon]
M:    [laugh]
N:    like that to her, and she used to go, ‘I’m not answering you, if you
      don’t use me name properly’, he goes, ‘right, you’re in’ [laugh]
M:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
N:    there was some characters but, it’s- they- some of them were good,
      but it was more like, sort of the older ones, you know, the proper old
      fashioned ones, but like, when they were all new, they were all like,
      sort of they’d either be intimidated by the kids or, they’d just like
      be super P-C, cos with it being a
TIME [26.00]
N:    as well, it was just, you know, people are all the more eager to
      complain aren’t they but
M:    oh, well the- there was no P-C when I was at school w- when-
N:    mm
M:    w- started at school,
N:    [laugh]
M:    remember I told you that, when I slipped off that corrugated steel
N:    yeah
M:    I’d ripped all the skin off me fingers, and I went into school the
      next day, with plasters all over me hands
N:    mm
M:    and the k- the teacher caned me on the same hand
N:    mm
M:    now that was- I was about- I was probably about nine or ten when that
      happened
N:    mm
M:    you know, and- and- and they were wicked, and we used to have this-
      this one teacher, [anon] (0.5) you know the three foot ruler they used
      to use on the- on the board
N:    yeah
M:    that was used for whacking you on the head with
N:    [laugh]
M:    [laugh] [inc]
I:    [laugh / gasp]
M:    and we had- we had another one, [anon], and he had a whip (0.5) and
      he had- it had a wooden handle, about so big, yeah, and then it was
      like- it was like a belt about, such a length, there, and he used to
      hit you with that and it used to wrap round your hand and come back
N:    [gasp] lethal
M:    and flick you, it was- he was a nasty piece of work him
N:    mm
I:    God
M:    yeah, yeah (0.5)
TIME [27.00]
M:    and then this- this guy called [anon] he- he was erm, he was really
      nice, this- I was probably about eight years old, and he’d erm, he’d
      been caught in the erm, the retreat from (0.5) Dunkirk
N:    right
M:    erm, and he’d been on the beaches for like three or four days waiting
      to get a boat back home in the Second World War, and erm, he was shell
      shocked
N:    ahh
M:    and- but he was a really- a really, really nice teacher and dead
      tolerant and everything, but if you upset him
I:    [gasp]
M:    ah, he used to, and he’d boil, and his face would be red-
N:    go crazy
M:    yeah, and he’d go really, really crazy, like everything’d come out of
      him, you know, but he was- there used to be like about thirty-six kids
      in a class
N:    yeah
M:    and every-
N:    cos think, they were a lot smaller when I was at school
M:    yeah, every Friday night, before we went home, or every Friday
      afternoon, he’d buy the whole class a bar of chocolate each
N:    aww
M:    he was- he was great, he was really nice, but he used to have this-
      this
N:    flip side
M:    yeah, yeah,
N:    yeah
M:    like this- this- this bit of erm (0.5) schizophrenia sort of spate
      you know, that he’d-
I:    [gasp]
N:    yeah
TIME [28.00]
M:    he just- he’d just switch completely
N:    yeah, to someone else
M:    and he could be a l- yeah, could be a little bit scary
N:    yeah (0.5) that’s- that- my favourite teacher though was [anon], me
      History teacher, cos she was great, and cos I-
M:    oh you- she loved you, because you loved history
N:    yeah, oh I know she loved me, yeah, cos I loved history but, there
      was that- she was like that though, she’d boil, she’d be dead nice and
      like dead chatty and if you loved work and you wanted to work she
      loved you, but if you wanted to just like doss about, she didn’t have
      any time for you, and there was this lad in my class, [anon], and he
      wanted to be a pilot, and he- he did history just because he wanted to
      learn about the planes that were used in the wars, and he’d obviously
      didn’t get to learn that much about it at-
M:    [laugh]
N:    I don’t think, to what he was expecting but-
M:    why cos- cos he pilots trolleys round tescos does he now [laugh]
N:    yeah, yeah, I think he actually- I think he has got his pilots
      license now though, but erm, yeah, and he used to like sit next to me
      like in class, I remember I was doing this mock test as it was coming
      up to our GCSEs,
TIME [29.00]
N:    and sh- she’s stood there and she’s like, going through all the
      answers after and everybody’s saying like what they got, and what they
      got, and she’s saying what the right answer is, and then he’s going
      like down this page and he’s going, ‘I haven’t got that question’, so
      she’s going, ‘you must have it [anon], you must have it, you’re just
      not looking at it right’, ‘I haven’t got it, I haven’t got the next
      one either’ like that, and she goes, ‘let me have a look’ like that,
      so she takes the paper off him, and he’d been doing a completely
      different paper to all of us, it had got mixed up in there and he
      goes, ‘I wouldn’t mind, but I thought it was a bit wrong, cos when I
      looked at Natalie’s [anon] answers in the exam’
M:    [laugh]
N:    ‘they weren’t anything to do with my questions’ [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
N:    and you could just see- that’s what she was like, she was quite pale,
      and she had this big like, mad perm, so her hair was like, out on end,
      and you could see the blood, you know, like rising up her face, and
      he’s going, ‘there’s gonna be steam coming out of her ears in a
      minute, there’s steam coming out of her ears’ and he used to like
      really wind her up, and like, you’d be outside the class, and she’d
      line you all up to come in and then she’d walk down the line and make
      sure you were all in (0.5)
TIME [30.00]
N:    and then she’d let you all go in, like one by one and he’d be like,
      behind me in line, going ‘walking the mile’
M:    [laugh]
N:    ‘walking the green mile’ [laugh] she was proper like- cos we did all
      the Nazis and everything
M:    oh sh- was she the one that was dead chuffed cos you had a copy of
      ‘mein kampf’ yeah
N:    yeah, yeah, yeah, I had it in me school bag, cos me Dad had leant it
      me and I’d literally read about four pages, and she saw it like as I
      was unpacking stuff
M:    and decided Hitler was a nutter [laugh]
N:    yeah, yeah
M:    and put it away [laugh]
N:    and she like picked it up and she’s stood there in front of the class
      going, ‘look at this, Natalie’s [anon] got ‘mein kampf’.’ And I was
      like, ‘shut up’
M:    [laugh]
N:    [laugh] they already think I’m a swot [laugh]
M:    yeah, cos what- that lad used to say, ‘beam me up swotty’ didn’t he,
      to you?
N:    yeah, yeah, in first year, yeah
M:    [laugh]
N:    ‘beam me up swotty’ yeah
I:    [laugh]
M:    [laugh]
N:    but he- she was that enthusiastic about Hitler and all the Nazis and
      everything, just- not about what they did, obviously, but just about
      teaching about it, and it was the bit she was obviously really
      interested in, he’s- this lad, [anon], used to call her, [anon]
M:    [laugh]
N:    cos she was just so into it, I remember we went on this trip to
      London, and we’d had to have like this essay in about something to do
      with the Nazis before we went,
TIME [31.00]
N:    and he’d not done it, and she’d give him like and extension, to give
      it to her before we went on this trip, and he’d still not give it to
      her and we were sat at the back of the coach on the way there and he
      goes, did- I said, ‘did you give her that essay?’, so he goes, ‘did I
      heck, no I didn’t get it in, I just avoided her all day today ‘til we
      were leaving’, so I went, ‘oh right’, and we were having a laugh about
      it, and I said, ‘she won’t let you get away with it you know’, he’s
      like, ‘I know, we’ll be there on the London Eye and she’ll be like,
      climbing up the side of it with the essay in her mouth’ [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
M:    [laugh]
N:    and he was like, one of those, they sat there at the back, you know,
      drinking vodka out of a cap like, [laugh]
M:    [laugh]
N:    have it in a seven up bottle or something [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
N:    crazy (0.5) it’s always like-
M:    did you ever keep any animals in the class at school, did you ever?
N:    h- erm, not at high school, we didn’t, no, at primary school we did,
      we had hamsters (0.5) erm, and stick insects
M:    oh, we- we had- we had a hamster when I was in primary school, we had
      budgies, and we had two rabbits, but we used to-
TIME [32.00]
N:    oh, we had fish as well
M:    we used to use the rabbits as an excuse to get out of class
N:    [laugh]
M:    and they used to stink in the back of the classroom, because they-
      they were basically belonged to me and this other lad, they kept the
      hutch at the side of where we were
N:    [laugh]
M:    and rabbits, ah
N:    they smell, yeah
M:    God, they smell something awful
N:    yeah
M:    and these never used to get cleaned out, we used to take them for a
      walk in the yard so we could get out of lessons [laugh]
N:    [laugh]
M:    we had a big yard,
N:    [laugh]
M:    when we had this hamster, there was this lad in our class called
      [anon], we used to call him [anon], and he was
I:    [laugh]
M:    you know, these big and daft kids
N:    yeah
M:    he was a real one of these big and daft kids, and the hamster got out
      (1.0) [laugh]
N:    [laugh]
M:    and I said, ‘hey [anon], it’s there, behind you’, and he stands back,
      and he crunches its head under its foot [laugh]
N:    ahhh
M:    [laugh] [inc] and this hamsters like [noise]
N:    aww
M:    [laugh]
N:    twitching

N:    yeah, through its bottom lip
M:    and its teeth had gone through the bottom jaw bit yeah,
I:    oh
N:    ah
M:    so we- we took it out and a- asked the teacher if we could go and
      bury it, so we took it out and buried it while it was still alive
      [laugh]
TIME [33.00]
N:    ahh, Dad!
M:    [laugh]
N:    that’s awful
M:    it wa- it just wasn’t quite dead, you know [laugh]
N:    I bet it was when the weight of the dirt went on it
M:    yeah, well, I don’t know, but it was starting to rain so we thought
      we’d better get on with it [laugh]
N:    ooh, so not only was it twitching and half dead i- under soil-
M:    yeah, yeah
N:    it was drowning under there as well
I:    oh my God [laugh]
M:    [inc]-
N:    oh no, we had hamsters, and we had erm, you have always have
      hamsters, don’t you?
M:    yeah
N:    remember- cos [anon] had that hamster that he brought home as well
      (0.5) we had fish, and I remember one of the fish died and the teacher
      was like, ‘oh, you need to flush it down the toilet’, and I was really
      upset, cos we had fish when we were little, didn’t we? Goldfish, and I
      was like, ‘you can’t put it down the toilet, it’s not right’, ‘oh it’s
      dead, it’ll be alright’ and i- I was like, I-
M:    you’ve got to bury it
N:    yeah, but I was like worrying about it, she went off and did it, and
      I’m thinking, ‘God, what if it isn’t dead’, it would be like stuck in
      the u-bend, you know, in the toilet
M:    [laugh]
N:    just there forever, swimming around [laugh]
TIME [34.00]
N:    and then we had the stick insects that no one wanted to clean cos you
      had to take them out, ooh God, I don’t like insects
M:    well, when we had-
N:    at all
M:    when we had the budgie we used to- cos we used to get them to stay in
      at dinner time, cos there was always a reason with us for having a pet
      in the class, it was either
N:    yeah
M:    to get out of the class or to get in the class when the teachers
      weren’t there, and the budgie, we used to be able to get in straight
      after dinner because, ‘let the budgie out for a bit of exercise while
      the other kids all-’
N:    [laugh] did he not just poo all over?
M:    no, they don’t, well we had- we had budgies, we kept budgies when you
      was a kid
N:    yeah
M;    you know, all they did was eat the picture frames, weren’t they,
      budgies and cockatiels, you know
N:    yeah
I:    [laugh]
N:    yeah
M:    but erm, the classrooms when I was a kid, they were huge, the
      classrooms
N:    mm
M:    with really high ceilings and you couldn’t catch this bloody budgie,
I:    [laugh]
N:    [laugh]
M:    cos the- the teacher used to have to have one of these- these poles
      for opening the top windows the- you know-
N:    oh yeah, we had them, yeah
M:    and erm, we couldn’t catch this budgie so we used to squirt it with
      water pistols until it got soaked and it couldn’t fly
N:    [laugh]
M:    and then- then throw and old curtain over it [laugh] and wrap it up
      in a curtain and stick it back in the cage
TIME [35.00]
N:    aww [laugh]
M:    it was really well looked after, you know [laugh]
N:    I’m surprised it ever bothered to come out to fly
M:    one of- one of the cleaners took it home in the end before it just
      fell off the perch [laugh]
I:    [cough] [laugh]
N:    aww [laugh]
M:    [cough]
N:    oh, that’s nasty, remember them cockatiels we had though, and we used
      to let them out and they’d fly around in the living room and I had
      one, mine was [anon] like the grey one, wasn’t it, with the red cheeks
M:    yeah
N:    and then [anon] had, what was his, [anon]? His white one, was it
M:    [anon], the white one, yeah

      and they were going behind and me [anon] was there, and he’s quite big
      me [anon], isn’t he? And he was like, running around
TIME [36.00]

N:    from one side of the rockery to the other trying to catch these
      rabbits, remember that happening
M:    mm (1.5)

M:    think the dogs are getting a bit restless aren’t they, they’re at the
      back door

N:    I thought- I thought I haven’t got anything in the washer [laugh]
M:    [laugh]
I:    sounds like it
N:    sounds like the washing machine moving
M:    well I used to- I used to collect like frogs and newts and what have
      you when I was a k- cos it- that was the kind of things we did, we’d-
N:    yeah
M:    go up to, I mean they call it ‘Black Harry’ up here now, don’t they,
      but we used to call it dead railway at the side of [anon] golf club
N:    oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
M:    there’s- there’s three lakes there
N:    right
M:    that, at the time, we called them the three sisters, and there was a
      stream that was part of the old railway that had been taken up years
      ago that- that used to run up the side of it
N:    right
M:    we used to get all the frogs and newts there, well I had erm, a demi
      jar, and it was about a- a gallon sized demi jar, you know, with
      really thick glass
N:    mm
M:    and we lived on the flats over here in Salford, and then I had, all
      [laugh / cough] I was great at keeping pairs, believe me, we had-
N:    [laugh]
M:    had all of these frogs in it, or newts which it was,
TIME [37.00]
M:    but, they were on the veranda, in the sun, in this jar, and they had
      no air getting out for water, and they boiled [laugh]
N:    [laugh]
M:    because the water was come- because the sun was coming through this
      jar, and there was only like that much water in it, you know
N:    yeah
M:    and they boiled alive in it
N:    aww
M:    and I’ll come back and they’re all upside down, dead [laugh]
N:    I bet me Nanna was glad, weren’t she, I bet she didn’t like having
      them outside
M:    oh yeah, she didn’t like anything like that, no
N:    no, so how did you like get from the flats to there, did you always
      just used to walk?
M:    we used to walk, yeah, or bikes, not like you lot, you know
N:    it’s quite far that
M:    ‘where’s the car?’ you know
N:    yeah
M:    no, we used to walk
N:    yeah, it’s quite f- do people not use the buses?
M:    we we- we didn’t have any bloody money, we were- you know, we were
      little kids
N:    mm
M:    we didn’t have a- you wanted to go somewhere, you walked
N:    used to go on your bike-
M:    I mean we used to go on an expedition to [anon]
N:    [laugh]
M:    you know, we- we’d go, we- we were all kids
N:    that’s quite far though isn’t it, from where you were?
M:    yeah, yeah (0.5) we were all kids and- and we’d have these Second
      World War water canteens
N:    [laugh]
TIME [38.00]
M:    and- and- and we’d be going on our adventures, we- we were going to,
      you know, we were off to fight the Second World War on the woods, you
      know
N:    [laugh]
M:    cos that’s what we got brought up on, it’s-
N:    yeah
M:    you know
N:    kids don’t do that now though, you never like see them playing out-
M:    no
N:    when they’re outside they’re just being a menace unless they’re
      really little like the ones around here, where they’re out on the
      bikes, you know, and stuff like that, and you see them on the
      skateboards and stuff, now they’re just
M:    I mean, we used- yeah
N:    vandalising summet aren’t they, or drinking on the corner, or-
M:    I mean we were, I mean the kids now, the- they’re nothing to what we
      were
N:    mm
M:    we were absolute little sods
N:    yeah
M:    I mean we used to have full scale battles for bonfire wood
I:    [laugh]
N:    [laugh]
M:    would, cos every- cos what- when we were kids, where we lived, there
      was loads of crofts all over the place, and that was cos we were so
      close to the docks during the war
N:    huh
M:    these are all bombsites, so you’d have a- a row of terraced houses,
      and four or five houses in the middle’d be missing, and there’s just
      be a croft
N:    right
M:    where a bomb had just hit that and the rest of the street was okay
N:    yeah
M:    and these were all over the place, and wherever there was one of
      these, the kids in that area, that was their bonfire spot
TIME [39.00]
N:    right
M:    so we used to have raids and raid the others
N:    [laugh]
M:    and nick there wood (0.5) but when I- I say raids, it wasn’t just all
      like, charging and shouting and what have you, we’re lobbing bricks at
      one another, throwing bricks, and we used to have bin lids as shields
N:    [laugh]
M:    honestly, cos I had my head split open three times
N:    [gasp]
M:    and- and in them days, I mean i- if a kid gets his head split open
      now, it’s off to the hospital and
N:    yeah
M:    have a cat scan and, whatever else, you know
N:    yeah
M:    no, know what I mean?
N:    yeah
M:    your Nanna’d just look at it, you know, bathe it, ‘oh, you’re
      alright, go on’
N:    yeah
M:    you know [laugh]
N:    back outside, get some more dirt in it, you’ll be alright [laugh]
M:    yeah, yeah, so I probably had me brains mashed at some time or other
      and it was just
N:    [laugh]
M:    just part of growing up
N:    mm, yeah
M:    no, that we’d- we’d- we’d played on the demolition as kids
N:    mm
M:    when they were pulling all the old terraced houses down, now if
      they’re bringing any- if they’re pulling anything down, there’s a
      bloody big secure fence around it and the kids can’t go in
N:    yeah, and they have all them signs up don’t they and stuff
M:    yeah
N:    well now, if kids do go on it and hurt their self, they end up
      claiming, don’t they
M:    yeah, well we used to be walking cos they’d- they’d strip all- all
      the wood out of them, they’d strip all the- the floorboards out of
      them, and just leave the joists
TIME [40.00]
N:    mm
M:    and we’d be upstairs, maybe two, three stories high, walking along
      these joists with nothing- and- and that was just part of it, that was-


N:    yeah
M:    part of what we did, that was part of growing up
N:    yeah
M:    you know, but we were- I mean what the kids do these days was nothing-


N:    mm
M:    and I mean all this asbo rubbish, and all that lot, we would’ve been
      getting them all the time
N:    yeah
M:    we were absolute little swines we were
N:    I think what it is now, is just people- kids then were just like
      naughty, and they were playing, but now, they’re just disrespectful
      aren’t they, I think
M:    well what I- I don’t think
N:    there’s a difference, isn’t there?
M:    we weren’t naughty so much as (1.5) we never caused any trouble at
      home, you never caused- y-
N:    yeah
M:    you basically, you didn’t shit on your own doorstep
N:    yeah
M:    for want of a better description, you didn’t erm, but there was-
      there was
N:    but people were just curious and that
M:    yeah, there was always a group of us, and that’s all we had to play
      with
N:    yeah
M:    you know, I mean, the- I remember there being a batman craze when I
      was about what, probably about six or seven, it was-
N:    mm
M:    it was the original batman series where it was all ‘kapow’ and
      ‘kazam’ and all this lot and-
N:    [laugh]
M:    ‘Batman and Robin, the boy wonder’, you know, and erm, we were mad on
      it,
TIME [41.00]
M:    so the whole estate, you’d have like, sixty, seventy kids, all with a
      lone ranger mask, cos that’s all we could afford for a couple of pence
      from the paper shop, and a curtain tied round you [laugh]
N:    [laugh]
M:    you know, as your cloak (1.0) y- your batarang, or was it the bat
      rope, no the bat rope was a coat hanger on a piece of string
N:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
M:    and yo- you’d be throwing it over walls and trying to walk up the
      wall like batman did
N:    [laugh]
M:    [laugh] like that, you know [laugh] and that’s what we had
N:    yeah (0.5) but now you see- I saw some- a little kid the other day,
      in a full batman suit,
M:    not having none of that, o
N:    just walking round Morrison’s with his Mum
M:    no, we had none of that, we had a- we didn’t even have the right
      mask, it was the lone ranger mask
N:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
N:    just something to
M:    you know, and that- that- that’s what we had
N:    cover your face, yeah
M:    yeah, yeah, and everybody’d be running round going ‘batman, de, de,
      de, de, de, de, de, de, de’ [laugh]
N:    [laugh]
M:    you know
N:    well it’s like when I was-
M:    it’s crazy
N:    little I remember like there was- there was like sort of two ways of
      dressing up f- f-
M:    do you mind if I smoke?
I:    no, that’s fine
N:    for Halloween weren’t there, there was like
M:    you got ashtray Natalie [anon]?
N:    erm, yeah, but it’s out there (0.5)
TIME [42.00]
N:    erm, there was like two ways of dressing up for Halloween, there was
      like, you could either-
M:    [inc]
I:    there’s only about two minutes left (0.5) okay
N:    get you like erm, proper stuff- remember when I used to have them
      witchy fingers,
M:    [inc - in the distance]
N:    do you remember them that you used to put on, and then like they’d
      have the red nails on the end, you’d have them or you’d just like go
      totally the other way and just wear summet black and tie a bin bag
      like round you and then you’d just go and run round if you wanted to
      be really lazy, and just knock on the doors, but then when you’re a
      kid like you love doing that and then like, when you get older now,
      and all the kids start coming round, you just like close the curtains
      and turn all the lights off and pretend you’re not in so you don’t
      have to give them anything
I:    [laugh]
N:    [laugh] cos like, when I had my other house, I- I didn’t have any
      sweets in, I’d completely forgot, and I had like a few chocolate
      biscuits, and then, like, I gave a few of them out, and after that I’d
      run out and they were like, this last group come round, and I was
      like, ‘oh, I’ll just give them twenty p each’ you know, and then once
      they knew there was money coming from one address
M:    they all
N:    they all came back and started knocking on the door, so I had to like
      turn all the lights off downstairs,
TIME [43.00]
N:    and go and sit upstairs, in the back bedroom cos like the terraces
      are like, alleys, aren’t they, in between?
M:    yeah
N:    so they wouldn’t know we were in there, so we was like camped out in
      the bedroom for the whole night at the back, with like this tiny
      little TV and the computer, just watching that like, ignoring them all
      knocking on the door [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
M:    well, when yous- when yous were kids I had the shop so you used to-
      you used to get everything you wanted, didn’t you, you’d-
N:    mm
M:    you’d come down for Halloween
N:    yeah
M:    and it’d be, you’d just choose from what was there
N:    yeah
M:    and get everything, and then your Mum’d take you trick or treating or
      whatever
N:    yeah
M:    they called it to
N:    go walking round
M:    [inc] the neighbours
N:    and then when they used to ask you for the trick you always used to
      be like, ‘I don’t know that, can’t I just have some sweets’
M:    [laugh] [cough] you remember them girls when we had the shop, or were
      you too young to remember that, who, you kept coming in the shop
      during that holiday and, ‘can I have a bottle of lemonade, can I have
      a bottle of-’
N:    mm
M:    ‘lucozade, can I have a bag of crisps, can I have some sweets’, and I
      was saying to your Mum, I was saying, ‘what’s- what’s going on with
      Natalie [anon] here, she- she’s eating an awful lot of stuff, she’s
      not normally like this’, and that- that older girl was sending you in
TIME [44.00]
N:    mm
M:    saying, ‘go and get this off your Dad, and go and get that off your
      Dad’
N:    yeah, it was like, there was them benches round the side weren’t
      there
M:    yeah, yeah
N:    I was telling [anon] that cos he was- we’d drove past the shop the
      other week (1.0) but I think it was when we went up to [anon] we were
      coming back, and they’ve took all the trees down in front of it now
M:    yeah
N:    [inc]-
M:    and there’s a lay by isn’t there, yeah
N:    yeah, do you remember when we used to stand there, me and [anon], and
      we used to be ripping all the bark off them trees
M:    yeah
N:    and stuff at the side, and then there was the chippy next door, and
      then I was telling him about when we used to sit in the video shop
      when it was closed in the day, and we’d like, sit in behind the
      counter and there was like the door for the store room, and we had
      like them little goblins that used to stick and roll down things, and
      we used to be throwing them at the door, and racing them
M:    [laugh]
N:    like down the door and th- but they never used to make it all the way
      down, they used to always get half way and fall off
I:    [laugh]
M:    aha
N:    yeah, cos they were just covered in that much dirt from the floor
      that they didn’t stick anymore
M:    and fluff out your pockets, and- yeah
N:    yeah [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
M:    but I remember that girl though, cos I- her Nanna was a real good
      customer in the shop
N:    yeah
M:    and when I- I told her Nanna about it, cos I came round and I-
N:    saw
M:    these girls were sending you into the shop, and her Nanna- her Nanna
      had a walking stick
TIME [45.00]
N:    [laugh]
M:    [laugh] and she battered her all the way home with this walking stick
N:    [laugh]
M:    because she’d been doing that sending you into the shop
I:    [laugh]
M:    [laugh]
N:    [laugh]
M:    God, that was rough down there wasn’t it? Where that shop was, that
      was really rough, yeah
N:    Yeah, [anon] still not that nice now though, is it
M:    no, no Beirut
N:    and they’re building all them houses now aren’t they, around it
M:    yeah,
N:    to hide it, the middle of it
M:    like they did with Ordsall, yeah
N:    yeah, building all nice stuff-
M:    erm, if- if you go down [anon], then you go down [anon], it’s all
      nice new buildings all the way down both of them-
N:    yeah
M:    and Beirut in the middle
N:    yeah
M:    you know, so people buy in it, don’t they
N:    they hide-
M:    even though what’s behind them
N:    yeah, it’s cos in-
M:    yeah
N:    cos they’re bringing all the BBC up and everything
M:    yeah, yeah
N:    they’re hoping they’re all gonna move in aren’t they
I:    yeah
M:    ‘media city’ or something they’re calling it aren’t they, yeah
N:    yeah, and that’s going on the Lowry isn’t it, what used to be there
      though, where the Lowry is?
M:    The Lowry? That was the docks
N:    oh right
M:    that was, I mean, when I was a kid, I mean, all the big ships used to
      come up there, and- and the Trafford swing bridge, that used to turn
      quite often, cos when we used to go to the matches, go watching
      United,
N:    mm
M:    quite often you’d be waiting to cross over while the bridge turned
      and a big ship went through
N:    right
M:    cos the ships come up from just past the Mersey were they started
      digging the ship canal, right into Salford docks
TIME [46.00]
N:    right
M:    cos Trafford park was one of the biggest industrial areas in Europe
N:    right
M:    but there’s nothing there now
N:    no, it’s all like warehouses isn’t it, yeah
M:    yeah
N:    yeah
M:    and apartments that are empty
N:    [laugh] yeah, that no one wants to live in, yeah
M:    yeah
N:    right on an industrial estate (3.0)
M:    but yous didn’t- yous didn’t get up to half the things, did I- I told
      you about that time we were riding on top of the lifts didn’t I?
N:    yeah
M:    yeah (0.5) [inc] the caretaker on that block of flats, me and my mate
N:    yeah, and the controllers were on top of the lift
M:    yeah, the controls were on the top of the lift and people were able
      to get into the life and push the button
I:    [laugh]
M:    and then we were able to override it on the top, so they’d push
      seven, and we’d take them to two
N:    [laugh]
M:    and then, ‘what the bloody hells wrong with this lift’, and they’d
      push seven again and we’d take them to the ground floor
N:    I hate that though, when you’re in a lift
M:    [laugh]
N:    and it doesn’t do what you want, cos you always think, ‘I’m gonna get
      stuck, the doors not gonna open’, I did it at work the other day, I
      went in the lift, cos they’re working on our building at the minute,
TIME [47.00
N:    so we have to- cos we’re on the ground floor, they’re working on like
      all the floors in between, where we were able to go to the toilets,
      cos there’s not toilets on ours, erm, and then the ones where they’ve
      got nobody on them, they’re block- they’re locked, so we have to b-
      going up to the seventh floor to use the toilets, and erm, like, I
      went in and I was that- I had me phone with me, I was on me lunch and
      I went in, I had me phone with me, I’m like messing with it, I walked
      into the lift, then it goes, ‘doors closing’ like this, I’m stood
      there and I’m thinking, ‘it’s not going’
M:    I can’t understand why they have that
N:    nothing’s happening and I’d just not pressed the button, but it was
      quiet, and then the lights started going off
M:    mm, mm
N:    and I was thinking, ‘oh God, I’m stuck’ [laugh]
M:    I can’t understand why they have that, ‘doors closing’ (0.5) I mean,
      cos if you’re blind you can hear it, if you’re deaf you can see it,
N:    yeah
M:    and if you’ve got all your faculties you know the bloody doors are
      shutting don’t you [laugh]
N:    [laugh] yeah
M:    so I- ‘doors are closing’
N:    and if you don’t, you will do when you get stuck in it [laugh]
M:    yeah [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
M:    ‘doors are closing’, I was telling [anon] about when they were (0.5)
      refurbishing erm, Victoria station in Manchester
N:    yeah
M:    did I ever tell you about the- the row of (0.5) erm, portable toilets
      that they put in there, never tell you about that?
TIME [48.00]
N:    I don’t think so, no
M:    when we were kids, I was about thirteen, fourteen, and we went up
      there, and they’re re- redoing all the- and the- they’d closed the
      toilets down and they’d put this row of portable toilets in (0.5) well
      we found out you could go round the back of them, and you could flush
      them from the back (0.5)
N:    [laugh]
M:    [laugh] so we used to wait until people went into the toilet,
I:    [laugh]
M:    got comfortable, and then flush it on them [laugh]
N:    [laugh]
M:    ‘what the hell’s that’ you know [laugh]
N:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
N:    wait for a scream
M:    but we were behind and they didn’t- they- they didn’t know that you
      could get behind them people, and then they’d go out and they’d be
      soaking and what have you, somebody else’d come in, flush it again on
      them, you know
N:    [laugh]
M:    we had a great afternoon [laugh]
I:    [laugh] simple things [laugh]
N:    yeah
M:    aye
N:    it is, isn’t it? It is simple [yawn]
I:    cool, that’s great for that bit, that’s fantastic
