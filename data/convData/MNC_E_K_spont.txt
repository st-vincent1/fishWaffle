      a lover of dolls, but me Mother’d dressed this doll up for Christmas,
      and it was all in green georgette, I’ve never forgotten that
K:    oh right
E:    and I’d gone out shopping with me Mother, we lived up near Hope
      hospital then and I’d gone out with her, to Eccles, and when I came
      back, the doll was on the settee, leant up against a- a cushion, and
      me two older brothers were there, I hadn’t got the younger one then,
      and erm, (0.5) they’d scooted out of the house you see when we came
      home (0.5) and when I picked the doll up, and, they’d gagged it

E:    hmm
I:    mm
K:    and so I could sit at the back of the class, and what I took in, I
