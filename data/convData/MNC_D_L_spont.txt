L:    that’s cool
D:    so he’s not doing bad, but he said he wants to get back into the erm,
      to the building (0.5) but erm, the last- the last guy that he worked
      for was an absolute (0.5) arsehole
TIME [03.00]
L:    yeah
D:    and erm, so he’s just put him off, you know, like the guy lived in,
      up Bolton way
L:    yeah
D:    and he used to have to be at this guys house for about (1.0) erm,
      used to have to be there for half six in the morning
L:    Jee- yeah, I remember you saying that
D:    and this was before- this was before he could drive
L:    he had to get the train or something
D:    so he had to like, get the bus at like half five in the morning, and
      you know, if he was late, the guy wouldn’t wait for him (1.0) so
L:    that’s horrible
D:    I think he just kind of thought (0.5) ‘sack that, I’m not- I don’t
      wanna be working in the (0.5) bricklaying anymore’ sorta thing, but,
      but I’ve been trying to tell him, you know, he needs to get back into
      it cos he can’t
L:    yeah
D:    stay at [anon] ‘til forever and ever more, the longer you’re out of
      the game,
L:    yeah, you’ll [inc] it won’t you
D:    the harder it’ll be to get back into it (1.0)
L:    well he’s had his like, first job, so that’s the hardest bit isn’t
      it, cos
D:    yeah, definitely
L:    when- then you can get references
D:    yeah
L:    whereas our [anon] useless
D:    yeah
L:    he hasn’t had a job yet he’s- well, he said he’s applied (0.5) he d-
      he dropped out of college (1.0)
D:    what college was he at?
L:    he w- he w- he was at [anon] and then he dropped out of that and I
      think he applied for [anon]
D:    mm
L:    and I don’t think he went for the first day
D:    [laugh]
L:    and then just, didn’t go
TIME [04.00]
D:    what was he doing at- at [anon]? (0.5)
L:    erm, he was doing Computing, he was doing, is it Cisco, is that what
      you were doing?
D:    Cisco, yeah
L:    yeah, I think he was doing that, but he said the- the teachers are
      wankers and
D:    nah, yeah, it was basically- all it was, was (1.0) erm, online
      modules sorta- sorta thing
L:    right
D:    so we just used to sit there in front of a computer for an hour just
      reading through these, you know, all these modules
L:    yeah, and then just doing the test
D:    and then, like, yeah, and then at the end of each module you have to
      have a test (0.5) and there was no sort of (0.5) like teaching
      involved in it, there was like, (0.5) it was just, you know, you just
      sit there and read it, I think the only thing we did (0.5) erm, you
      know, practical stuff, cos it was all to do with networking and
      computers and stuff like that, we learnt how to, you know like y- when
      you get your Ethernet cables?
L:    yeah
D:    we learnt how to make them
L:    oh right, that’s alright
D:    and we learnt to strip a computer down, and then put it back
      together, they were the only things we did for the whole two years
L:    wow [laugh]
D:    so, there’s no wonder I did- I didn’t erm, (1.5) I didn’t pass it,
      cos when, you like, you’d complete all your modules and then at the
      end of it you have to take a (0.5)
TIME [05.00]
D:    you know, like a test covering all the modules
L:    yeah
D:    so, and then if you fail that test you have to pay for it to do it
      again
L:    oh my God [laugh]
I:    oh
D:    so I failed it and I thought, ‘no’
L:    ‘I’m not even bothering’
D:    ‘I’m not- I’m not even going back’ but you have- it’s like something
      like sixty pound a go
L:    jeez
D:    and you know, back when I was working on four pound an hour in- in
      Trafford Centre [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
L:    [laugh]
D:    sixty pound was quite a bit of money (1.0)
L:    how did you do in your Electronics?
D:    erm, Electronics in the end, I come out with erm, a D
L:    that’s good
D:    so, better than nothing isn’t it
L:    yeah
D:    erm, Music Technology, I only- I scrapped that after the first year
      didn’t I (0.5)
L:    yeah, cos you pick four (0.5) four equivalent A-levels don’t you, and
      then drop one (0.5) or something
D:    well no, basically I dropped it because it was,
L:    [inc]
D:    just- I just didn’t like the tutors at all, like you know at- when I
      was in school I was into all me drums and stuff
L:    yeah
D:    and I like loved music, but then as soon as I got to college (2.0)
      just, I don’t know what- I don’t know what, but it’s just changed my,
      like erm, opinion of erm, (0.5) you know, trying to be a (1.0) a
      musician sort of thing
L:    oh, that’s a shame
D:    so yeah
TIME [06.00]

      practice enough

L:    oh, yeah
D:    he was-
L:    I- I rarely had him though, I had, what’s the other one called, I
      think she was called [anon] or something (1.0) but
D:    I don’t remember her
L:    she- I think she was only there for like a year
D:    yeah, I know but cos- cos he was a drummer as well, you know, he like
      really encouraged me and (0.5) and erm, you know, he used to help me
      out wherever he could
L:    that’s cool

      (0.5) do you- what was the worst thing you ever got into trouble for
      at school?

      was erm (1.0) in RE he was our RE teacher, I can’t remember if it was
      a woman (2.0) she was-
D:    no idea
L:    she was horrible, but
D:    it was one of them subjects that you just don’t pay attention to
      [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
L:    yeah, she complained at me for me handwriting at some- at one week or
      something, and then the next week she gave me detention cos me
      handwriting was still bad and I’m like [laugh]

D:    ahh, the worst- I got in trouble for a couple of things, when we was

      and [anon] just head-butts it
L:    [laugh]

      I’m sat there with like two pi- two pieces of wood in my hand
I:    [laugh]

      the desk with me head in it

      always up to no good
L:    [laugh]
D:    and yeah, just, so she just used to- she never used to like us I
      don’t think so (0.5) that didn’t make it any better (0.5) but yeah,
      Science, I reckon (0.5) cos it was a pretty run down school by the- by
      the time we was there

L;    they had Bunsen burners, that was it,
D:    Bunsen bur- Bunsen burners

D:    yeah
L:    she’ll just carry on, she’ll get slightly on a tangent, and then
      she’ll move straight onto it, and then-
D:    I think a lot of Gran’s are like that aren’t they
L:    go in a circle (0.5) well
D:    cause my- my Gran, cos she lives down in Southend with my Aunty and
      erm, so she- all the time she’s on the phone to me Mum (0.5) and me

D:    [laugh] she’s dead- she’s dead-
L:    he’s a firefighter your Dad isn’t he?
D:    yeah, fireman, yeah (1.5) I always remember random stories he used to

      his, erm, the lads that he first started working with, erm (1.0) like,
      this building’s on fire (0.5) and there’s just got a picture of them

      doing the driving (0.5) erm, (2.0) you know, we used to be really busy
      everyday, you know, like with like ten or twelve jobs to do everyday,
      but now, we’re down to about two or three
L:    [inc]
D:    you know, on a good day you’ll be like, you’ll have like one big job
      for like eighty people and that’s considered a busy day now
L:    woah
D:    whereas like, back when (0.5) we first started (0.5) you know, used
      to do like six jobs for twenty people, so (0.5) so it has- it has erm,
      you know, been scaled back a lot (1.0) with all the cuts (1.0) so it’s
      kind of erm, [sniff] no, I don’t see- I don’t see- I’ve not seen her

      down and built houses over it (0.5) erm, with like a- just a smaller
      church to the side (0.5) and we used to just like, used to have like,
      you know like the massive fences along, erm

      day, one of the stabilisers fell off
D:    yeah
L:    like, on its own accord, I was like, ‘fine’, so, he took the other
      one off I thought it was pretty good
D:    really? I remember when my Dad who’s like, you know, like running
      along behind, holding the seat so I wouldn’t wobble, and then

      inertia, and you can pedal faster and you’ll be alright’
D:    yeah [laugh] (0.5) ahh, they talk about that word all the time don’t
      they
L:    [laugh]
D:    it’s true though [sniff] (1.5) like when- like on me bike when I’m
      going round corners, you know, or j- or like you’re trying to do a u-
      turn, the faster y- you, obviously not like twenty mile an hour but,
L:    yeah [laugh]
D:    the faster you’re going, then it- the easier it is to manoeuvre it

L:    it was
I:    was anything bad near you?
D:    I live- I live fairly near to the Salford precinct where it was-
I:    really
D:    all taking place, you could see, there was a couple of cars on f-
      that they’d burnt out, think it was like the Manchester Radio car
TIME [25.00]
I:    yeah
D:    erm, then they’d, you know like, tipped it over and burnt it out, you
      could see the smoke for miles (0.5) erm, and my girlfriend, she’s
      like, nosey
I:    [laugh]
L:    [laugh]
D:    so we- so we had to go for a drive round didn’t we
I:    [laugh]
D:    so we went for a li- for a little drive round and you know, like all
      the roads to the precinct there’s just like, lines of li- riot police
I:    gosh
D:    erm, and they all looked knackered
I:    [laugh]
D:    they’d been stood there for ages
L:    yeah
D:    you know, without a break, felt sorry for them, one of my Mum’s
      friends (0.5) erm, he works erm, you know, training and co-ordinating
      the riot police
L:    yeah
D:    so he was- he was like up for like forty-eight hours straight or
      something daft like that
L:    jeez (0.5)
D:    it was erm- it was all madness wasn’t it though, but I think (0.5)
      there’s erm, like I say, just a lot of people spoiling it for the
      majority, a lot of people in Salford are (0.5) decent people
L:    yeah (1.5)
D:    erm, just erm, what was it- cos I was watching erm (1.5) is it
      Question Time with young voters last night (0.5) and erm, it was
      saying that, you know, there’s a lot of erm
TIME [26.00]
D:    (1.0) you know, it’s not just people you know, being idiots, there is
      a lot of underlying problems that they think is the cause
L:    yeah
D:    there are broken families and all this (1.0) erm, did you hear what H-
       Hazel Blears said? In h-
L:    ahh, I was listening on the radio, I wanted to turn it off she just-
      so irritating
D:    in erm, was it in the houses of parliament where she said erm, you
      know, ‘why aren’t- why aren’t your kids in school’ and it’s like, it’s
      the summer holidays [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
L:    [laugh]
D:    ahh, but erm, watching- watching the news as well with- I’m sure the-
      the news people just go around and find the most stupid people to talk
      to
I:    I know, they do
L:    [laugh]
D:    the stupidest people to talk to and, you know, give interviews to
      (0.5) and, you know, you can see why half of them haven’t got jobs
L:    yeah
D:    the way- the way they talk and act
L:    there was one that I was listening to and he- he’s like this black
      guy and he- he was like, ‘so, why are you rioting’, and he went, ‘oh,
      it’s just the police, I hate the police, cos they- they hate us, they
      can’t stand the colour of our skin, we’re like, black and Asian and
      they don’t even care about their own colour skin’,
TIME [27.00]
L:    it’s like, they’re not being racist then are they, they’re just,
      indiscriminant [laugh]
D:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
L:    like you, plad [laugh]
D:    they’re just- they’re just stupid aren’t they (0.5) see that guy that
      was in Manchester city centre with his erm, with his t-shirt pulled up
      over his face and his- and his sunglasses on, and he was like, ‘the
      police can’t touch us today can they (0.5) it’s free reign’
      [imitation] thought, ‘oh’ (0.5) I was just watching it and I was
      thinking (1.5) ‘why?’
L:    what’s the point
D:    what are they- what do they think they’re gonna achieve, you know, if
      they wanted to vent their anger I’m sure they would find better ways
      than erm, smashing up their own communities (1.0) did you hear erm, TJ
      Hughes on the precinct, the- they’ve closed it down now
L:    have they, oh
D:    because erm, you know cos it got that badly damaged in the riots
L:    yeah
D:    erm, they just decided that they can’t afford to erm, you know,
      repair it all, so they’ve just closed it down, so they’re just ruining
      prospects for people in their own community really aren’t they?
L:    yeah
D:    you know, that’s about, how many people do you reckon are working
      there, fifteen, twenty people, that’ve just lost their jobs
L:    they now are jobless, yeah
D:    so they’re just adding to their own problems and- they just don’t
      think about it do they
TIME [28.00]
D:    (2.5) it’s erm, (1.0) it’s all stupid (0.5) I d- I don’t see why they
      were rioting anyway, I think they were just
L:    just any excuse for them
D:    copy- copy cat riots from, you know, cos I think in London it was all
      to do with that guy getting shot wasn’t it
L:    yeah
D:    erm, but up here, they j- they had no reason at all did they really,
L:    no
D:    they were just copying it, getting away with it cos th- you know,
      because they could get away with it (1.0) so (1.0) but erm, watching a
      few erm, videos you know, that (0.5) have been posted on youtube of
      people getting arrested
L:    [laugh]
D:    and erm, [sniff] what do you reckon- what do you reckon about erm,
      you know, if people do get convicted then they should loose their
      benefits
L:    I reckon that’s quality, and loose their house, everything
D:    mm
L:    that’s a good idea
D:    at- see I- at first I- I thought that, you know, yeah, cos they
      shouldn’t have been involved in the riots and why should the tax payer
      have to, you know, pay for the clean up
L:    pay for all the damage, yeah
D:    and pay for them who have caused the mess
L:    yeah
D:    but then I was watching (0.5) when I was watching the- that programme
      last night (0.5) and it was saying, (1.5) you know, erm, is it not
      just
TIME [29.00]
D:    gonna cos more problems cos these people that are already on low
      incomes or no incomes have got, you know, nowhere to go, so are they
      not just gonna start causing more trouble than all this
L:    yeah
D:    so, there’s a bit of a argument for both sides of it really isn’t
      there [inc]-
L:    deport them
D:    deport them, yeah
L;    yeah, send them all somewhere else
I:    mm
D:    just make them live on a small island
L:    [laugh]
D:    or Australia, like back in the day
L:    execute them
D:    [laugh]
L:    [laugh]
D:    did you see that about the- was it that e-petitions where they’re
      trying to get erm, [sniff] you know, the death sentence brought back
      sort of thing
L:    yeah
D:    aren’t they (0.5) all mad aren’t they?
L:    well, I think it’d be quite good cos it’ll get like- jail’s like
      blocked up anyway
D:    yeah
L:    if you get one’s that are stuck there for life anyway, what’s the
      point in them being around
D:    that’s very true (0.5) very true (0.5) erm (0.5) I don’t think it’ll
      deter anybody though cos, you can imagine, in America they still have
      high crime rates, it doesn’t really deter anybody does it
L:    no, I suppose not
D:    with- with criminals it’s erm, (0.5) when they’re committing acts of,
      whatever (0.5)
TIME [30.00]
D:    erm, they don’t really think about the consequences do they,
L:    no
D:    they don’t think, ‘oh, I’m gonna get banged up for twenty years for
      smuggling ten pound- ten million pounds worth of class A’ or whatever
      (1.0) they just want to do it because they’re greedy aren’t they, or-
L:    yeah, but if they do get rid of them then we’re not paying to house
      them in jails as well, so it’ll make it cheaper for us (0.5)
D:    mmhmm
L:    should bring back the cane in schools, and let police beat everyone
      up it’ll be great
D:    [laugh] that’s another one of the topics that was on that programme
      last night, he was saying that, you know, how can you expect these,
      you know, these kids, to respect the police when-
L:    they can’t- the police can’t do anything
D:    they don’t even respect- they don’t even respect their own Mums’ and
      Dads’
L:    yeah
D:    and you’re taking the powers away from the- from the Mums’ and Dads’
      to, you know, enforce that respect, because you know, even smacking a
      child is frowned upon and
L:    yeah
D:    stuff isn’t it, you were saying that-
L:    can’t shout at anyone without ending up in prison [laugh]
D:    yeah, yeah, too erm, (0.5) too P-C, politically correct, isn’t it,
      you know (0.5) it’s all-
L:    it’s human rights and all that crap
D:    bollocks in my opinion
L:    yeah
D:    never did me any harm (0.5)
TIME [31.00]
L:    no, it’s good
D:    get- getting a smack round the back of the legs (2.0)
L:    oh, I always thought back of the head was worse
D:    no, no, trust me, the back of the legs was worse (0.5) you know,
      especially coming from my Dad
L:    [laugh] I can imagine
D:    he’s massive isn’t he?
L:    yeah (1.5)
D:    that was erm, fun times when I was a kid, well I d- I don’t get
      people that, you know, it’s never aff- it’s never affected me in- in
      any way, any- anybody that I know that got (0.5) you know, a clip
      round the ear once in a while
L:    yeah
D:    you know, it’s not affected them in (0.5) you know, like, adversely
      sort of- sort of way has it, you know
L:    I suppose they’re trying to protect people who are constantly abused
      but,
D:    yeah, but
L:    if they’re gonna be constantly abused then they’re just gonna be
      constantly- like, putting a rule in saying ‘you can’t hit your kids’
      isn’t gonna stop them
D:    yeah, there should be- I think they need to look at it don’t they
      (0.5) change the rules
L:    they do (2.5)
D:    so have you- (4.0) I don’t know (2.0) [sniff] (1.0) what erm- what
      ways did you have to help around-
TIME [32.00]
D:    help around the house when you used to live at home with your Mam?
      (1.5)
L:    erm, I dunno, my Mum was more of a slob than us, so it wasn’t too
      bad, but you know what my Mum’s like, she’s (0.5) she only did like,
      the pots and the tea every now and again,
D:    yeah
L:    it didn’t really matter to be honest, we were more (1.0) we all did
      our bit and that
D:    aha, yeah
L:    you have to do anything?
D:    used to- used to be like a fight in our house every weekend, you
      know, like me Mum (0.5) dragging us out of bed at like ten o’clock on
      a Saturday morning when you just wanna sleep
L:    really
D:    cos you’ve been up like playing on your Xbox or whatever, ‘til like
      three in the morning
L:    [laugh]
D:    she’s dragging us out of bed going, erm, (1.5) trying to get us, you
      know, to tidy up different things like, you can wash the pots from
      last night and (0.5) she used to make us like al- hoover all the-
      hoover all the- all the stairs and landing and clean the bathroom and
      stuff like that [laugh]
L:    ah, my Mum was pretty cool with all that, I think she did most of it
      (0.5)
D:    yeah (0.5)
L:    think she just erm, made us clean our rooms, and any mess that we
      left out she, like, we cleaned that up
D:    yeah
L:    but she did the rest (0.5)
TIME [33.00]
D:    (1.5) she w- the funniest (0.5) I look back on it now and I- I- I l-
      laugh on it, but when- when we were kids, like cos me and my brother
      used to have to share a room, [sniff] erm, if that you know, became,
      messer, and me Dad used to warn us, like two, or three times you know,
      saying, you know, ‘tidy your room up’
L:    yeah
D:    and then if we didn’t do it, you know, just go, ‘oh you know, we’ll
      just leave it, do it another time’, erm, (0.5) we’d come home from
      school one day and he would like have ripped everything out of the
      wardrobes, all the toy boxes would be emptied
L:    [laugh]
D:    you know, just everything in a big pile in the middle of the floor
      and he’d just go
L:    ‘sort it out’
D:    ‘sort it out now’ y- you know, ‘you’re not going out until you’ve
      tidied your room’ so we used to have to sit there for like you know,
      three hours, just
L:    that’s quite good that
D:    tidying the room, and then it used to be spotless for about two
      months, but then it used to get back to the same thing [laugh]
L:    [laugh]
D:    that’s why- but my room now (1.5) you know, it’s always spotless so I
      think that’s been drilled into me, you know
L:    mine would be if [anon] wasn’t in it all the time
D:    oh, God
L:    she’s so messy
TIME [34.00]
D:    every time [anon] comes ro- eve- every time [anon] comes round to
      ours, you know, it just- it’ll be, you know, there’ll be a few clothes
      you know, on the back of the chair or whatever, but she’ll just like,
      throw her bag on the floor, her shoes and everything and
L:    [laugh]
D:    ah, it annoys me (0.5) you know, just spent half an hour cleaning up
      and then you come round (2.5) and erm, mess everything up [sniff]
L:    yeah, I live at me own in [anon] at the moment, and it’s just bliss,
      it’s just like, nobody makes a mess
D:    yeah
L:    and then, if I make a mess I clean it up like pretty much straight
      away anyway so
D:    that’d be ace (3.0) erm
L:    I do miss [anon] like but [laugh] she comes round and visits me, and
      I’m round here more than anything, I think
D:    yeah (0.5) at least you’ve got her (0.5) your car, how’s your car
      doing?
L:    yeah, it’s alright, you can- like, it looks like there’s a really,
      really clean patch just on this wheel arch where I managed to scrape
      it up the wall
D:    [laugh]
L:    and it’s just got a different coloured paint on at the moment [laugh]
D:    [laugh]
L:    oh it’s only like a little scratch, but, yeah, it’s alright
D:    mm
L:    I’ve had a (0.5) erm, just had me car insurance
TIME [35.00]
L:    (1.5) renewed
D:    how much-
L:    but I pay it in one
D:    how much?
L:    it was (0.5) well, the renewal price was one, six (1.0) then erm, I
      changed to Admiral for like an ultra low mileage
D:    yeah
L:    so, and then it got it down to one, four, and then I put [anon] on
      it, and it went- knocked it down to one three (0.5) I was like
D:    that’s weird isn’t it?
L:    that’s brill, but they’ve now got a tracker in it to check my mileage
D:    you’ve got to have a tracker on it?
L:    I’ve got it on it, yeah (0.5) but it’s- all they do is just check how
      many miles you do in the year, and if you go over then you gotta pay a
      premium (0.5) cos I said I’ll only do five thousand miles
D:    yeah
L:    which is why it went cheaper (0.5) but if my car ever gets stolen or
      anything I can like phone them up and say, ‘can you just- my car’s
      been stolen can you-’
D:    track it sort of thing
L:    yeah, turn the tracker on
D:    that’s a- that’s a- that’s alright isn’t it?
L:    and then they give it all to the police, and the police go and find
      it
D:    that’s decent (0.5) my bike’s got so many cracks down the side of it
      where the previous owner dropped it on the floor
L:    ahh, have you not like, dropped it or anything yet,
D:    nope (0.5) not dropped it at- I- I came off it in
L:    I can’t see any cracks actually
D:    it’s on the- it’s on the other side (0.5) I came off it in erm
TIME [36.00]
D:    in Buille Hill park luckily,
L:    yeah
D:    you know on the grass
L:    yeah [laugh]
D:    so that was (0.5) the only time I’ve fell off it (0.5) so far (0.5)
      erm, and it was actually quite funny, I got up laughing to myself just
      going, (0.5)‘oh my God’
L:    [laugh]
D:    but yeah, there’s like big cracks down the side of it (0.5) and you
      can see where, like it was been painted over sort of thing, but it’s
      like, cos it’s like, it’s like shiny isn’t it
L:    yeah
D:    but, on the other- on the other side, erm, it’s just like matte,
      matte blue paint
L:    ahh
D:    and it just looks stupid (0.5) erm, but I can’t complain for what I
      paid for it and the mileage on it [sniff] there’s still- it’s not even
      got a thousand miles on the clock yet
L:    has it not
D:    mm
L:    wow
D:    ah, it’s great for, you know, just going back and forward to work
      (0.5) you know, takes me like, well, not half the time, but you know,
      depends what time, if I’ve gotta go you know, down to [anon] at (0.5)
      you know like five o’clock and it’s really busy, just zipping through
L:    mm, weaving
D:    zipping through the traffic is pretty cool, but (1.0) did I tell you-
      did I tell you about that argument what I had with that van driver?
TIME [37.00]
L:    (1.0) I think you did
D:    yeah, I was like just –
L:    oh, you were going past weren’t you?
D:    yeah, I was ju- I was just like going past the line of traffic and I
      stopped to let him- to let him come past on the other side of the
      road, and erm, he starts shake- shaking his head at me going, you
      know, like mouthing off in his van going, ‘ah, what you doing this
      for, what you doing this for?’
I:    [laugh]
D:    so I was just like you know, g- give him the fingers
L:    [laugh]
D:    and he pulled up at the side of me there, and he was like proper
      screaming in my face going, ‘why don’t you get to the back of the
      queue, all these other people have gotta wait’ and I was like,
L:    ‘I’m on a bike’
D:    it’s part an- ‘part and parcel of having a motorbike to be honest
      with you mate, you know, I’m not gonna sit in a queue of traffic when
      I can just (0.5) overtake everbody am I’
L:    no [sniff]
D:    oh, gotta think-
L:    I really want a motorbike now, what?
D:    gotta think- gotta think sometimes (2.0) erm, (1.0) have you not
      thought more about getting yours?
L:    I have but it’s
D:    are you gonna wait a couple of years do you reckon? (0.5)
L:    yeah, probably until like, we get our own place and that, cos
D:    yeah (0.5) cos I reckon- you probably need a garage to store it in,
      to
L:    yeah
D:    to save it from getting nicked
TIME [38.00]
L:    I could put it in the back garden at the moment, but
D:    mm
L:    it’s cost as well
D:    yeah
L:    if I could get rid of my car then I would, but I can’t for
D:    no, well if you- if you, you know, cos I know, the reason I got rid
      of my car was cos the insurance was just (0.5) was too high
L:    yeah
D:    you know, I think I was paying two thousand pound, and it was only a
      little fiat punto
L:    yeah
D:    so I thought, you know what, erm, this doesn’t justify it, you know,
      I only travel, you know, n- not far to work do I, I walk to work most
      days, so I just got rid of it and got that cos it’s cheap as chips to
      run, three hundred and fifty pound a year on me insurance
L:    that’s quality
D:    and erm
L:    my tax is nearly that, road tax [laugh] what was your road-
D:    how much- how much is your tax for a year?
L:    oh, it’s about two hundred and fifty five I think
D:    bloody hell, do you know how much it is on that
L:    it’s probably about five or something-
D:    fif- fifteen pounds for the year [laugh]
L:    fifteen, ahh
I:    [laugh]
L:    don’t laugh, it’s not funny [laugh]
D:    ahh [sniff] yeah
L:    no, it is well worth it, I would do it, but (0.5) I need a car to get
      [inc]
D:    yeah, it can be- it can be a bit of a-
I:    [cough]
TIME [39.00]
D:    a pain in the arse, you know when it’s raining or it’s a little bit
      cold, but
L:    yeah (0.5) wait ‘til snow comes in winter-
D:    well I’ve been- I’ve been riding it since the middle of- since the
      middle of January, so
L:    oh, right
D:    you know, I’ve been out- I’ve been out there in the cold and- and
      everything like that, you know, with me long johns on [laugh]
L:    [laugh]
D:    underneath me thermals (0.5) so, I erm, I can, I’ll be- plan to be
      riding it until it starts snowing and [sniff] getting icy, so, then
      it’ll go in the garage until I can get it out again
L:    yeah
D:    oh, depends on the job front, I might (0.5) get a car (0.5) but the
      insurance- insurance
L:    a cheap one, insure it for a month or something?
D:    insure it- yeah, just insure it for a month
L:    get on [anon]
D:    erm, I’m al- I’m already on [anon]

      Swinton every day (0.5) told her to get a motorbike but she won’t have
      any of it
L:    I can imagine [anon] on a motorbike [laugh]
