R:    Rhys       [Left]
I:    Interviewer

NB: There is a problem with the Left channel between 02.06 and 02.20

      on those (0.5) there,
R:    oh yeah
N:    so he’s done tho- you see that one, this was a puzzle we got (0.5) it
      was erm
R:    that’s not right that
N:    yeah, it is, that’s- that’s right on there (0.5)
R:    oh yeah, I suppose it is
N:    so that was that one, so I think he’s done that- it took him three
      days to do that (0.5) but he’s erm, he just persevered and persevered
      and that was it, and he’s done them all, so that was erm, that’s
      pretty good, (0.5) and the other thing is, erm, what was I gonna say,
      I’ve got your- those (0.5) ‘Kiss’ magazines for you,
R:    ooh
N:    about time too and all
R:    I was gonna say, mm, yeah

N:    [laugh] and there’s a DVD that I bought from-
R:    and what was that like?
N:    oh it was- well, we watched it last night, I put it on, erm, it was a
      concert that was recorded for- in the MGM grand
TIME [01.00]
N:    that should’ve been on the internet, it should’ve been streamed on
      the internet
R:    yeah
N:    and the servers crashed apparently so they didn’t watch it, and erm,
      but the concert went ahead, but there’s on- the must’ve only been
      about four hundred people there
R:    was there?
N:    and it was- but it was just invited guests, but anyway, it’s just a
      DVD
R:    is it any good?
N:    aye, it’s alright but it’s- but again, it’s- it’s only like four
      songs, so I mean it’s-
R:    four songs?!
N:    yeah
I:    [laugh]
N:    but it
R:    that’s not a concert
N:    I know, but it was only like erm, a promotion thing for the- for- I
      dunno if it was opening a hotel or-
R:    you’ve been ripped off Noel [anon]
I:    [laugh]
N:    [laugh] it w- it was only two ninety-nine the- the DVD, so we watched
      that anyway, so we did that, so I’ve put that in the packet for you as
      well
R:    oh thanks
N:    so I’ve got that, so I can trade you for your Classic Rock magazine
R:    oh well,
N:    so you’ll be alright with that (0.5) so have you been at Dad’s today?
R:    yeah
N:    what’ve you been doing?
R:    painting
N:    have you?
R:    did the ceiling
N:    right
R:    ceiling is done and the s- that dado rail’s done
N:    right
R:    un- undercoated, erm
N:    [inc]-
R:    then we moved the furniture so we can get in and do some
TIME [02.00]
R:    stuff tomorrow and
N:    right
R:    I mean, it’ll be done in a room and-
N:    has he repaired the ceiling?
R:    yeah
N:    he has
R:    it’s been done, went to B and Q as well, so
N:    what did he- what did he need? Just to get some plaster on it or has
      he sort of done it
Problem with right channel (Rhys)

R:    [inc] plaster is fine he’s

N:    right
R:    [anon] done that flashing, then he’ll be- be alright
N:    oh has he been up on the- has- oh has he been on the roof and done
that?
Right channel (Rhys) resumes
R:    well, he was at some point yeah, so if that’s been done then
N:    he wants to come to our house and d- I saw him in the pub you know
the-
R:    yeah, and he wants to come to my house and all
N:    [laugh] he was in-
R:    [clears throat]
N:    in- in fact, he came to the [anon] last- last Thursday
R:    and I knocked his head in
I:    [cough]
N:    yeah, and I said erm, ‘so are you coming to our house’ is it- oh he
      said, ‘I’ve- I’ve- I been to your Dad’s to do his- to do his roof’ and
      I says, ‘well, you want to come to our house and do ours’ and he went
      ‘oh, I’ve been really busy’ I thought, ‘you lazy bastard, you’ve done
      nothing’ [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
R:    yes, nothing
N:    I thought, ‘he hasn’t done it’ so erm, (0.5) so that was erm- so that-
       so is Dad- did Dad say anything about working with me tomorrow?
R:    yeah, I think- erm, no, he’s not working with you tomorrow I don’t
      think
N:    right
R:    I think [anon] gonna carry on painting
N:    oh right, I-
R:    do some stuff
N:    cause I-
R:    then I think he’s with you on Thursday or something
TIME [03.00]
N:    right, that’s tomorrow
R:    oh is it, Friday then
N:    did he say Friday, he might come down on Friday
R:    Friday I think
N:    right
R:    but I mean like, once that ceiling’s done, I mean there’s nothing to
      those walls in that room
N:    no
R:    to be honest
N:    cause he was saying about- when he was saying about getting a- a new
      bed he was saying about moving his old bed into there and I said, ‘you
      don’t want’- and getting himself a four foot bed or something, and I
      said, ‘you don’t want to do that, you just want- you just wanna, erm,
      use a bed that you’ve, you know, use his old bed for him and buy a new
      bed for that
R:    yeah
N:    for that room, so I’m sure he’ll do that eventually anyway
R:    no, I hope so
N:    so he should be alright with that one (0.5) so have you been- are you
      working the rest of this week or are you off for- for the- the- at all
      this week?
R:    I’m working tomorrow and then I’m working (0.5) Friday and Saturday,
      off Sunday
N:    right, are you working d- days Saturday or evenings? (1.5)
R:    evenings
N:    right (0.5) cos I was gonna- I- I think at some point I’ll have to
      try and get down t- town cos I wanna go to that [anon] and what’s the
      other one? (0.5)
R:    I could maybe do that during the day or something
N:    yeah, but (0.5) but are you working during the day?
TIME [04.00]
R:    I’m not working ‘til five I think
N:    right
R:    I think I’m working at five
N:    just depends what time I get away cos I- I won’t finish ‘til half one
      or something
R:    oh
N:    so I’ll have to erm, (0.5) we’ll have to have a- have to have a think-
       about- about going over there cos with [anon] and [anon] away, we’ve
      got like a free weekend, although, [anon] going to see erm, (0.5) Les
      Miserables or something is it, at erm, (0.5) The Lowry
R:    oh right
N:    she’s going there with erm, [anon] and [anon] they’re having like a
      girly night- a girly night out (0.5) so erm, (0.5) hopefully might-
      might get away on Saturday so that looks alright
R:    mm, okay
N:    so we’ll go at erm, we’ll just have a- a quick these. Can you r-
      remember, yeah, where did you go to school? It says on here [laugh]
      come on with you, come on, I know exactly where you went [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
R:    well, secondary school Noel [anon]
N:    yeah, secondary school
R:    well, [anon] oh dear
N:    and where was [laugh] and what sorry?
I:    [laugh]
R:    oh dear
TIME [05.00]
N:    no they weren’t- weren’t the best days of your life at- no, it was
      alright, I think I’d er- it says here, did you ever get into trouble
      at school?
R:    no, I was very good
N:    [laugh] unlike me
R:    unlike you, Noel [anon]
I:    [laugh]
R:    I was ver- I was very good at school, and I think there was a lot of
      pressure from Mum and Dad, well, certainly from Mum to do well, erm
N:    at school?
R:    yeah
N:    why?
R:    why? cos I think [anon] had done well at secondary school, so because
      I think she was classed as intelligent, I was expected to follow suit,
      erm and I didn’t think I could erm, kind of do that well really, and
      it really used to bother me, that I wasn’t intelligent enough and I
      was really quite scared about not going to grammar school
N:    yeah
R:    and going to a secondary school but, in the end of the day I’ve got
      the qualifications and I suppose won’t, so I think there was some-
      some pressure
N:    yeah
R:    not from outside or from the school, I don’t think the sc- the school
      or friends or neighbours really cared about anything but I think
TIME [06.00]
R:    I think it was Mum who- for Mum it was important that you- or I think
      for me, my standard was- was to study and do the right thing I think
N:    yeah, I didn’t feel any pressure at-
I:    [laugh]
N:    at school
R:    no you didn’t, no [laugh]
N:    no I didn’t at all [laugh] I just- I just didn’t wanna go to [anon]
      [laugh]
I:    [laugh] yeah
N:    which was- which was erm, I didn’t wanna go there so but I- I don’t
      recall e- e- when we went to [anon]
R:    well you never went
N:    I did, I did go to school but I mean, I- I missed the odd day and I
      think but, I- I just erm, I d- I didn’t feel- feel pressure (2.5) with
      [anon] I suppose because she went- she went to the girls grammar and-
      and I think she’d- but I- I always felt as though I was following in
      your footsteps at school because all the teachers sorta knew you, so
      every time I mentioned my name, they goes, ‘oh you the brother of- of-
      are you [anon] brother?’ and then y- you know, but you were quite good
      at school, so I mean, it-
R:    I was good at- I was good at most things and some stuff I wasn’t
N:    yeah, whereas I didn’t- I didn’t sort of like, I didn’t do any
      homework, as such, and I didn’t erm
TIME [07.00]
N:    (0.5) I didn’t sort of erm, I mean- I mean I went to lessons but I
      mean I- I didn’t work- work as hard as probably I could’ve, I didn’t
      sort of, use my full potential, so to speak
R:    I think if somebody had actually turned round and said, ‘it doesn’t
      really matter sometimes’
N:    yeah
R:    ‘and you can mess up and you don’t have to get (0.5) great grades and
      that’s still okay’ then I think that would’ve been a good thing, but
N:    yeah
R:    it was kind of never really said so, (0.5) I think you’d- I just
N:    I-
R:    I just wanted to do well and I- I mean I didn’t mind staying in and
      studying, I think, you know, I was perhaps a bit more introvert than
      you
N:    yeah, I don’t [inc], but, yeah
R:    in some respects
N:    see that’s it, I didn’t erm, I didn’t like the staying in, studying
      bit, I’d rather be out playing foot- you know, playing football or
      messing about with- with people so (0.5) that’s erm- that was my
      school days
R:    well I think I preferred the books
N:    yeah
R:    rather than the football, and the physical stuff, no
N:    oh I couldn’t read, I could- well, I could read but I didn’t bother
      [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
N:    didn’t bother with that one, I liked doing Maths but I mean that was
      erm,
TIME [08.00]
N:    that was- that wasn’t too bad, so erm, I was gonna ask you another
      question then I can’t remember what it was, cos erm, what was it
      about, wasn’t about school, it was about something else [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
N:    I was gonna do- oh yeah, how was Leeds, when you went to Leeds?
R:    we-
N:    cause you just- with [anon]
R:    erm, [laugh] Leeds was good, about half an hour before I met [anon]
      she’d split up with her boyfriend (0.5)
N:    sh- oh I see
R:    so erm, that wasn’t a good thing, erm, but yeah it was good fun, we
      went for dinner and-
N:    where do you go- where do you go for your lunch?
R:    [anon]
N:    is that just a ch- is- was that a chain a bars or is that a
      restaurant or something or
R:    it’s an Ir- Irish Wetherspoons
N:    oh right
R:    cheap
N:    is it?
R:    yeah
N:    or is it like one of those
R:    very ch- very cheap
N:    one of th-
R:    so we went there cos we had no money
N:    oh right, so is that one of those where you can get eight- you know,
      two meals for two qu- eight quid or ten quid or something?
R:    one meal for about three pound fifty or something
N:    oh, bloody hell
R:    so that was- that was good and had a walk round Leeds
N:    yeah
R:    nice (0.5) sunny, vibrant city
TIME [09.00]
N:    oh good
R:    erm,
N:    did you get the train up there or coach?
R:    caught the train
N:    yeah, how much is that now?
R:    about fifteen pound
N:    that’s not-
R:    fifteen pound an- an hour’s journey
N:    that’s alright, it’s like a bus service that isn’t it, didn’t- is- is
      it every hour or every half hour or something?
R:    every twenty minutes
N:    yeah
R:    so that was good,
N:    I remember that one
R:    I enjoyed Leeds
N:    so do you prefer- what’s erm- do you prefer Manchester or Leeds (0.5)
      as a city? cos it’s-
R:    as a city?
N:    yeah
R:    erm, well I don’t know Leeds- I don’t know Leeds well enough
N:    well you’ve been a few times now haven’t you?
R:    yeah, to know whether I’d- I’d prefer it as a city
N:    right
R:    but I mean I think you could say that Manchester’s- most people would
      say that Manchester outside of London, is erm, probably the- the- the
      second capital of the UK
N:    yeah
R:    so many people want to study here at University, so many people would
      come here for work I think, erm, nightlife, social activity
N:    mm
R:    for a big city, it’s very vibrant
N:    yeah
R:    you got all your quarters, from the gay village to
TIME [10.00]
R:    the Chinese quarter, to the Northern quarter, to expensive shops from
      Harvey Nichols to, little cafes and restaurants and everything so
      (0.5) it’s a place I think young people would want to come
N:    yeah
R:    erm, and good transport links as well
N:    I quite like erm, getting the- go on
R:    but I think- I think Leeds is- is- is erm, kind of a clean and modern
      city as well
N:    yeah
R:    erm,
N:    I think yeah, I like going into- I mean I’ve never been into Leeds
      but I mean I like getting the train, you know, when we’ve got the
      train into Manchester from- from Urmston and you know, just had a-
      like a Saturday night in there, I mean it’s not a late night for- for
      us, cos I mean the last train back- train that’s back is what, quarter
      past eleven or something so I mean, you’re not out all night but, you
      know, like you say about going into the bars, there’s a lot of bars up
      at Deansgate, and just have a- a few beers or a little restaurants in
      there and, I mean it’s quite a good night out and it’s, I mean like
      you say, I mean there’s so many people in there compared to (0.5)
TIME [11.00]
N:    you know, Urmston I suppose on a- on a Saturday and, I was gonna say
      as well, that I don’t- I feel more threatened in Urmston going for a
      drink (0.5) then I do- then I do in the centre of Manchester (0.5)
R:    I don’t think Manchester’s threatening at all
N:    no I don’t, no, but I’m just saying the amount of people that are in
      there, you know all having a- having a few beers and, well it’s like
      at three in the morning I don’t know, cos I never stay out that late
R:    what, when something’s kicking off?
N:    [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
R:    [laugh]
N:    yeah [laugh] yeah it used to, when I was- yeah, that’s it, half two
      in the morning when- what was that- what was that- I just can’t think
      of that bar
R:    that club
N:    [anon]- there was [anon] I don’t know if that’s still there, do you
      remember [anon]?
R:    that’s probably burnt down Noel [anon]
I:    [laugh]
N:    yeah, [anon]
R:    I mean somebody’s- somebody’s torched it I should think
N:    [anon]- [anon], remember [anon] remember when we used to go in there
      (0.5) so that was erm, (0.5) so that was erm, that was good, cos I was
      saying to you, it’s- do you think that Ma- Manchester compared to
      [anon] where you used to live, now that’s two different cities, cos
      [anon] more of a cultural city than Manchester isn’t it (0.5)
R:    do I prefer it or
N:    yeah
R:    do you want me just to compare them?
N:    just where- wit- whe-
TIME [12.00]
N:    if- if you had the choice now of living in- living in [anon] where
      you used to live or in Manchester, or- or
R:    erm,
N:    you know, where you live now
R:    I think that is a really difficult question, because I have a very
      big history down in [anon], and there are things that I miss down
      there, erm, it’s a tourist city it’s- it’s got money
N:    yeah
R:    erm, I- I- I
N:    you haven’t got Lostock have you [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
R:    well no, it’s- no you’ve- you- y- you- your main- your main
      employment there is the University, that- one of the top ten
      Universities, and there’s the international students bringing in money
N:    right
R:    into a city, it’s a heritage city (0.5) with a Roman (0.5) archit- ar-
       architecture
N:    and there is a lotta tourists in- in [anon] though, isn’t there
R:    it- it- it- some money is constantly be- being brought in
N:    yeah
R:    erm, developments are kept to a minimum, you know, everything has to
      be rubber stamped with the council of listed buildings and that, erm a
      v- a very bohemian city, erm, very small and compact, I mean, you
      know, you haven’t got the
TIME [13.00]
R:    infrastructure like Manchester or the- the vastness of choice, erm,
      (0.5) but I would say you also don’t get a lot of your social problems
      that you possibly would in, you know, in- in a large- a large city
N:    yeah
R:    and perhaps some run down areas, erm, around Manchester
N:    mm
R:    which you just wouldn’t get in a place like [anon]
N:    yeah, I suppose the thing with [anon] is, I mean, because, I suppose,
      like holidays up there we used to go to [anon] and stay on a farm and-
      and, you know, our childhood was, I suppose our summer holidays, our
      childhood was- was up there and I have very good memories of- of being
      at [anon] (0.5) as opposed to, you know, going into [anon] I mean I- I
      enjoyed it as a- as a city, but I think
R:    well would you’ve ever lived in [anon]? If-
N:    I suppose if- if- if I had the choice- if- if I’d have got employment
      up there, it would’ve been a place that- that I would’ve liked to have
      lived
TIME [14.00]
N:    but I always- I always actually g- going back, when you lived there,
      I always thought that I knew [anon] better than I knew Manchester,
      because I never re- I never really went into Manchester (0.5) in- I
      suppose in me (0.5) early twenties I- I didn’t go- we didn’t go night-
      clubbing (0.5) or into the bars in Manchester, and I didn’t work in
      Manchester so, I mean, it wasn’t a place that I actually went a lot,
      whereas [anon], because you know, we used to go down I suppose with
      [anon] and [anon], [anon], and then you lived down there and, we’d
      played, you know, like we played golf that time in [anon] and we’d
      been to the theatre in [anon] and we- we been erm, y- you know, t- to
      various places, I just (0.5) thought that I knew [anon] better than I
      knew Manchester, but I would- I would’ve lived there, I don’t know
      what erm, (1.0) whether I would’ve enjoyed it, I suppose it’s
      difficult, I don’t know whether I’d’ve enjoyed it as much as I’ve- I
      enjoyed (0.5) the time I spent here, it’s diff- very difficult, to- to
      say, but I mean I would’ve
TIME [15.00]
N:    I would’ve been happy staying there and I did- I did enjoy the times
      that, that I went down when you were living there, you know, I mean we
      sort of-
R:    oh yeah, I- I enjoyed all those moments as- as holidays down there
N:    yeah
R:    as a family, erm, with their being countryside and a very different
      kinda- kind of vibe to it
N:    yeah, I was- I was saying the other day actually, do you remem- do
      you remember cos you were saying about camping I was- I was saying
      about erm, do you remember when- when we- when, erm, [anon] had that
      caravan on the front lawn
R:    oh yeah
N:    and we s- and we stayed in it that thunderstorm, and he let those
      fireworks off outside
R:    yeah
N:    do you remember that, oh that was- I mean, I don’t know how old we
      must’ve been then, must’ve been about bloody nine or ten or something
      I think, and they had those- those bloody aeroplane fireworks, (0.5)
      do you have a-
R:    I remember-
N:    do y- do y- do you remember those firew- the- the aeroplane ones that-
       that- that you turned- set them off and th- and they just used to go
      ‘whoosh’ into the air, and they’d go anywhere
R:    yeah, I remember those
N:    he was setting them off outside our caravan and we were crapping it

N:    yeah
R:    yeah, but they were good people, you know, they weren’t erm, they
      were nice people to be around
N:    yeah
R:    but I mean I can’t- you know, f- for me to have- I would- I would
      live in [anon] again, no problem, erm, but the reason I can’t is
      because I’m now priced out of a market, but, (0.5) you know what, you
      have a choice, you can either live (0.5) live in perhaps a very nice
      area,
N:    yeah
R:    and not get too much out of a job or something else and you have to
      weigh up your job, and your friends, and where your family is, of a-
      of a bigger picture of maybe what life is gonna
N:    mm
R:    gonna give you or what you’re gonna get out of it
N:    yeah
R:    erm, and there are things that I- I- I miss a lot about [anon] but
      there are things that I’ve gained by moving away from it

R:    erm, and as a city, I probably would not
TIME [17.00
R:    wish to live in Birmingham, I w- wouldn’t really wish to live in
      Liverpool
N:    no
R:    erm, or possibly, you know, Edinburgh or whatever, erm, and I think
      London is too big
N:    mm
R:    I mean it’s too expensive, but it’s too big
N:    yeah
R:    whereas a place like Manchester is (0.5)

      Dad told me, he says ‘I’ve sent a card’ s- he said- he said, ‘I’ve
      sent a card to [anon]’
R:    well, good for him [laugh]
N:    no but he said [laugh] that, no but he said- he says, ‘I’ve sent a
      card to [anon] from everybody in Manchester’ I thought, ‘thanks for
      telling me, A, you’ve sent a card, and B you’ve-’ I mean
R:    he was gonna do that for [anon] as well
N:    yeah but he could’ve said there was- that- that it was his birthday
      [laugh]
R:    I said it was a very- I said I was a very good idea, and carry on Dad
N:    what, ‘from everybody in Manchester’ I thought he should’ve just told
      me, I’d’ve sent me own card, I don’t wanna be part of ‘everybody in
      Manchester’, anyway, I was saying about erm, (0.5) the hotel we stayed
      in
R:    yeah
N:    this five star hotel, I mean we’d booked in, erm, for like a massage
      and- and us- use of the pool and everything, and erm, but I think it
      was about sixty quid for each, for the- for like-

N:    for one night, but you got erm, like I say, you got a spa treatment,
      you got a massage in there, we got dinner, which was thirty quid a

N:    no, well we actually- well we wanted a bottle of wine so we- so we
      thought well, the cheapest
R:    money to burn
N:    is thirty five quid, erm, so- so we had to have something, so I
      thought we’ll have that one, but erm, we actually took a bottle of
      champagne with us,
I:    [laugh]
N:    so we drunk that in the room before we- before we erm, before we
      went, so, well, before we went down for dinner so that was- that was
      quite good, so we had a good evening there, but erm, and then on the

      couple of hours is long enough but we just had a- a wander up the high
      street and- and there’s like erm, I suppose a not a woollen museum,
      but you know these places that sell tweed jackets and local brew and
      things like that, so we- we nipped in there and (0.5) and just had a
      look around and got summet from- went the tourist information centre,

N:    cause he- apparently he’s not very- he’s in- he was in hospital not
      long back with some alcoholic problems
I:    really
N:    which is a bit of a shame cos he was nice [anon],
I:    mm
N:    but, I think erm, I- I don’t know he- I think he sort of ended up
      living on his own, whether he’s in a flat or something I don’t know
      whether he ever got married or was divorced or something but I- he’s-
      he ended up coming in [anon] a lot
I:    oh right, yeah
N:    so erm, but anyway I heard from, well, it was [anon] brother, [anon]
      that- that send us- send us a text saying that [anon] was in hospital
      with some
R:    oh dear
N:    it’s a shame really cos I mean he can only be what- how old will he
      be, forty-nine, fifty
I:    mm
N:    you know, I mean it’s- it’s no age at all, although I know quite a
      few- well I know three or four people that have died through
      alcoholic, bloody
R:    mmhmm
N:    problems, but yeah my childhood was, I mean I suppose that that was
      spent down,
TIME [24.00]
N:    like you say, [anon]
I:    [laugh]
N:    and erm, with [anon] and, erm, there was [anon]- [anon]- [anon],

      remember- I can’t remember who he is now, I’ll come to him in a minute
R:    who?
N:    [anon]
R:    [anon]
N:    that was- that was one, [anon], and we just used to, I suppose
      there’s nothing really to do
I:    mm
N:    erm, we went to the, erm, [anon] youth club a few times (0.5) erm,
      but again you see, the trouble with that- that- that, again, there’s-
      there’s- there’s quite a few rough
I:    yeah
N:    people for in- went in there from like (0.5) I suppose it not the
      coun- oh I mean, you know, if you say ‘council estate’ it sounds
      really snobby
I:    yeah
N:    but I mean it’s-
I:    yeah
N:    it’s- it- it- you know, there’s people like that, so I mean it wasn’t
      actually (0.5) it was alright but I mean if any of them went you sort
      of felt a bit intimidated by it- by various things but, and then at-
      at school I mean, I suppose, some of me friends- I didn’t really have
      that many- I didn’t really have many- lots of friends,
TIME [25.00]
N:    I mean there was [anon], but again he- he used to live near us,
      [anon], who used to live near us,
R:    you used to have more friends than me though
N:    yeah, but I suppose some of that was, erm-
R:    you were more outgoing I think
N:    yeah but I mean, I used to play football for- when I first started at-
       so that’s a team of people isn’t it
R:    suppose so [laugh]
N:    so yeah, you got- you got eleven to start with
I:    yeah
N:    and I- I- I suppose erm, I suppose maybe I did, maybe I did go out a
      bit more in the evening, but I mean it wasn’t- I suppose it was more
      hanging round the street, then- then- then doing anything (0.5) you
      know, it wasn’t, like o- you know, other than Saturdays playing
      football ‘til I packed that in
R:    [laugh]
N:    cause I used to smoke in the bike sheds and that was- that was the
      other social calendar, wasn’t it, yeah
R:    was yeah, well it was for you
N:    who’d you meet round- round the bushes, having a fag
I:    [laugh]
R:    or the top of the road Noel [anon]
N:    yeah (0.5) so erm, so that was my social- social events
R:    I think most of mine was based around the band, you know, a school
      band
N:    yeah
R:    I mean I- I had two or three quite close friends I think, (0.5) erm,
      [anon] was quite a (0.5)
TIME [26.00]
R:    close friend and probably (0.5) erm, [anon] or something, the artist,
      who I quite liked-
N:    [anon], where did he live? Can you remember where he lived?
R:    I can’t remember and I think some of the- some of the people from
      primary school carried over into secondary school so
N:    mm
R:    there was a kind of (0.5) known following, you know, when- once you
      kind of got to
N:    yeah
R:    secondary school (0.5) erm, and people either got along or fell out
      but I suppose I just joined bands at that point, school bands and
      local bands, and they became (0.5) friends and they became people that
      you then
N:    yeah
R:    socialised a bit more with as you got a little bit older
N:    cos you played a couple of- I mean didn’t you play the civic centre
      with your band and hats?
R:    I think so, and I played somewhere in Urmston, [anon]
N:    where was that? Did you play there?
R:    I did
N:    I don’t remember that, I remember the-
R:    I do [laugh]
N:    do you
R:    yep
I:    [laugh]
N:    go on why, why do you remember that?
R:    why do I remember it? Erm, I think because you- you were shouting so
      much that you couldn’t speak afterwards [laugh]
N:    [laugh]
R:    and you’re just hoar- you’re voice was so hoarse
TIME [27.00]
N:    what, cheering you on?
R:    yeah, and I can’t think what garbage we played but we must’ve played
      a lot of
I:    [laugh]
N:    yeah but I used to, you see, that-
R:    loud garbage [laugh]
N:    you see that- that- you see that was it you see, I was- I was very
      proud, and I’ve said this to you before, I was very proud of you being
      in a band, and-
R:    I know you was [laugh]
N:    and the fact that y- y- you know, you play-
R:    but I was actually very proud of you playing football, cos I could
      never do that
N:    ah, I mean that’s- that’s- I suppose that’s brothers for you isn’t
      it, one’s good at one thing, one’s good at the other, but I mean I
      suppose, deep down I- I don’t know, I just used to like going to watch
      you play and I-, you know, telling people say, ‘oh, me, you know, you
      know, me brother’s in a band, come and watch’ cos I mean, I remem-
      remember seeing you, like I say, at the [anon], and- and [anon] (0.5)
      and even when you were in your band in [anon] (1.0) tha- that was erm
      (0.5) I have still got your CD up there,
R:    oh right, that’s good that
N:    aye, we’ll show [anon] the pictures after
I:    [laugh]
N:    [laugh] so we’ll erm, so I remember that, so who else- I- who was-
      was it [anon] that was in your band
R:    there was [anon] and, [anon]
TIME [28.00]
N:    (1.0) don’t remember that one
R:    erm, erm
N:    who was the guy who pl- who was the lead guitar at the front? (0.5)
R:    can’t remember
N:    can you remember his name, that m- was that [anon]? I can’t remember
      his name
R:    I can only ever remember about two people anyway
N:    yeah
R:    bet they played scout huts and stuff like that
N:    whatever happened to your drums? What happened to your- what happened
      to your dr- what happened to your drum skin?
R:    oh that, the drum skin, the painted drum skin?
N:    yeah
R:    it followed me down to [anon] I took it to [anon] and I think I just
      had a big clear out one day and it got in the skip
N:    ahh
R:    I really wish I hadn’t skipped stuff like that
N:    I bet, yeah, yeah
R:    but it- you know, (0.5) I think things were alright, you know, I- I
      was just more of a- a bit more of a recluse and a loner I think
N:    yeah
R:    I’d quite enjoyed staying in and playing records and- and stuff and,
      just having two or three quite close friends and the music
N:    yeah
R:    I don’t- I just don’t think I was particularly (0.5) outgoing to kind
      of go crazy, you know,
N:    and I, like I say, I mean I didn’t have- I didn’t have loadsa friends
      but they were- they were just sort of
TIME [29.00]
N:    I think- I think in later days I think [anon] I mean I spent a lot of
      time with- with [anon] (0.5) if you remember, and then he moved up to
      bloody Hebden Br- not Heb- somewhere up there, Hebden Bridge or
      something he met- he met [anon] who was about twenty years older than
      him
R:    oh that’s it, yeah
N:    with a- with two kids, which erm, (0.5) when you’re twenty I suppose
      that was appealing for him
I:    yeah
N:    you know, which is- but erm, he erm, I dunno, we lost touch then, and
      I’ve- I’ve not- I’ve seen his brother a few times, he lives in-
R:    yeah, yeah, I’ve seen him, [anon]
N:    no, his younger brother, erm, [anon]
R:    oh I think I missed [anon] I can remember [anon]
N:    well [anon] was your age
R:    yeah
N:    [anon] was the year younger than me, and then there was [anon] who
      was a different- who had a different Fa- in fact I think they were all
      different Father’s, I don’t know, but, he had a- he had drugs prob-
      he’s another one that had drugs problems (0.5) so erm, (0.5) that was-
      that was that I suppose, erm, did you have a favourite teacher at
      school? Going on about school (1.0) no [laugh]
R:    I- well, y- well, I suppose- I suppose I did in a- in a- in a strange
      w- I suppose I had a favourite teacher
TIME [30.00]
R:    and I had erm, (0.5) a probably not so favourite teacher, my
      favourite teacher- I did have a favourite teacher, erm, because he was
      very caring
N:    who was that?
R:    I think it was [anon]
N:    oh, I don’t remember him
R:    he was a Maths teacher but he just- it sounds very silly- silly or
      stupid at that age, but he just came across as very caring
N:    yeah
R:    he didn’t come across as erm, (0.5) a kind of teacher in a way
N:    so it w- eh, go on
R:    so I think- so I think I kind of liked him for- for that reason
N:    yeah
R:    not particularly for the subjects he taught but just because he
      seemed a caring bloke
N:    I was gonna say, cos quite a few of the teachers at school were
      quite, I think, Victorian, cos they were older weren’t they, it was-
R:    oh they were, I mean that Russian teacher was just, you know, a
      sadist wasn’t he
N:    yeah
R:    banging on desks and throwing chalk at people and
N:    yeah, and he-
R:    pulling your hair and being really quite obnoxious and nasty
N:    yeah, and then- and then there was-
R:    it- it’s no wonder somebody took a (0.5) either a knife to him one of
      them, or
N:    [laugh]
R:    you know,
TIME [31.00]
I:    [laugh]
N:    good school
R:    a fist or something
N:    someone probably it- yeah
R:    because- because they weren’t- they- they were
N:    he was quite- I mean this is it- cos I mean, when [anon] says about
      her school and they used to call them by, you know like, [anon] or
      [anon] or [anon] something, I mean ours was just, surname- it was just
      your surname they used to
I:    mm
N:    but they- they- they- I don’t know, they- it was very, I think
      disciplined was- was the word, I mean it was a boys’ grammar school, I
      suppose, it wasn’t mixed or anything but it was- it was just very
      Victorian in its- in its outlook at school and, you know-
R:    but it wasn’t over fun either was it,
N:    no, it wasn’t, no
R:    I mean it was (0.5) I suppose you were there kind of to study and you
      towed the line
N:    yeah
R:    and it was kind of Victorian but, I suppose the teachers who were
      there perhaps had grown up in a slightly different era even to what we-
       we had done
N:    well that’s it I mean-
R:    and I suppose it, you know, [anon] and [anon] now have a very
      different education
N:    oh yeah, I mean the-
R:    cause it’s a lot more open and-
N:    I think- I think like you say, I think the schools tend to be a bit
      more- I think they treat you more as people than they- than they ever
      did when- when- when we were at grammar
TIME [32.00]
N:    (0.5) you know, I mean, like you say, you were saying about your

N:    well you just wrote on it and it would carbonate on- onto the next
      sheet-
R:    oh they must’ve known Noel [anon]
N:    oh he did yeah, cos he caught me and it wasn’t-
I:    [laugh]
N:    wasn’t- wasn’t hard t- to notice that one (0.5) but erm, we did that
      and then, erm, I can’t remember what I had to write now, but (0.5) I
      remember- I remember him but I just- I just quite enjoyed, like, PE,
      cos I suppose that was the football bit, and I just couldn’t cover the-
       cover the proper subjects [laugh] (0.5) couldn’t do- couldn’t do them
      at all (0.5) so when are we- just erm

R:    so that’s gonna be a bit of a nightmare
N:    yeah, are they closing the other one completely?
R:    well, it’s gonna be rented out to somebody else, so we won’t have any
      kind of dealings to do there, so it’s gonna be
N:    yeah
R:    very much a different job and
N:    yeah (0.5)
R:    different vibe and erm different building so it’s gonna be really

R:    who’s going, is it just you and [anon]?
N:    just me and [anon] yeah, cos [anon] and [anon] have- well, [anon]
      been to Corfu with- with [anon] and
R:    mmhmm
N:    [anon] Dad, and then [anon] been away with [anon] (0.5) and then
      they’re b- going to V
I:    V
N:    this weekend
I:    yeah (0.5)
N:    so, I mean there’s just no- I mean th- we- we couldn’t’ve had a
      summer holiday this year with them anyway because of all the different
      things that were going on, so we just didn’t have time to do it that
      way so I mean, me and [anon] said ‘well, we’ll try and book a week
      when- when they’re back at- at Uni or- or back at school’
R:    I’ve never been there
N:    well we haven’t, that’s one of the reasons why I picked Portugal, or-
      because there’s that and- and Greece, I wouldn’t of minded going to
      Greece cos I mean [anon] and [anon] have been
R:    mm
N:    and you’ve been and that was another one, we said that or Portugal
TIME [35.00]
N:    so, it was just a- a matter of, ‘well, where do you wanna go’ so we-
      we sort of just went on the internet, and erm, look- looked up some
      apartments, found an apartment and then [anon]- we booked some
      flights, it’s not too hard, it’s about-
R:    oh wow
N:    think it’s about six hundred-
R:    [cough]
N:    it’s about six hundred quid [inc]
R:    what for the- just for the two of you for that
N:    think so yeah but-
R:    that’s not- that’s not bad, three hundred quid for
N:    yeah, but I think it’s cos you go out of school holidays
R:    yeah
N:    then it’s- you know, it- it- it works out that little bit cheaper
      (0.5) but we’re not gonna- w- we thought about hiring a car, for n-
      you know, to drive up, but I- I don’t know, cos [anon] had a look and
      even that’s summet like two and half hundred quid or three hundred
      quid for the- for the week, and you think, ‘well’
R:    right
N:    you know, if you got a transfer for- for seventy quid that gives you
      two hundred and fifty quid t-
I:    yeah
N:    to maybe get some taxis or something and
I:    mm
R:    yeah
N:    and the fact that we’re only going for a week, well I mean you’d-
      you’d spend the first three or four days looking round the-
R:    you might spend half your time just in the car
I:    there’ll be trips won’t there, going around?
N:    oh, the- we- well yeah because I mean they’re always have trip to the
      nearest
I:    yeah
TIME [36.00]

      they go to
I:    yeah, other cities and stuff
N:    you know, some- s- some building or- or like you say, the next- the
      next town- town along the- the beach
I:    yeah
N:    so there’s always that so we- we- we decided that we’ll probably just
      get a transfer to the- to the resort and then just see how it goes,
      but, [anon] and [anon], you know [anon] and [anon] who stayed in
      Barcelona?
R:    yeah
N:    they we- they- they’ve been to this resort, well, about six years on
      the trot or something, so
R:    oh well, it seems pretty good if they’ve-
N:    so we’ve sort of like took a recommendation
R:    got a recomm- recommendation from it
N:    yeah, so we’re gonna do- we’re gonna do that but-
R:    that is so unfair
N:    but this is our- this’ll be our- our first holiday without either
      [anon] or [anon]
R:    oh
N:    just me and [anon], so that should be- that should be- that should be
      interesting shouldn’t it?

      while we were out and they’d got a brand new
I:    mm
N:    box of- of this race night for two pound ninety nine, so I thought,

N:    and they give you a- all the- all the little slips, and y- you bet on
      who you think’s gonna win
R:    oh okay
N:    so they’ve- they’ve got like at the first race might be, I dunno,
      the, you know, the Dean Morris handicap or something and it’ll have
      all the horses on it, and it’ll say favourites this two, or whatever,
      and then you just- you just bet on it, and if yours wins or comes
      second or something, y- you win the money
I:    it’s like monopoly money as well with it
R:    oh, okay
I:    it’s good

      interesting, I mean you can have a- a few people over, few beers and
      some snacks, and, I mean that’s what- that’s what you did wasn’t it?
I:    yeah, yeah, it was good
R:    mm

      evening of it, but erm, who- who won the most money when you did it?
I:    we didn’t do it in the end but I did alright, erm, one of mine was
      something like six to one, eight to one, and I put three hundred on so
      I got like quite a bit back so
R:    wow
N:    [laugh] three hundred, yeah, can you imagine that in your own money

      me, Cluedo, it- there was a question in the quiz, in the pub, he says,

I:    mm
N:    or in the instructions, where it’s set, and it’s Arlington Hall (0.5)
I:    mm
N:    so just remember that for your quiz, summet-

R:    ‘this is where Cluedo is set’
N:    it might do yeah, Wikipedia
I:    yeah, it’ll be on Wikipedia
N:    be on- be on there won’t it
I:    someone could’ve made that up though if it doesn’t say [laugh]
N:    I- but this- this is what I thought, I thought I wonder if somebody
      has just made- just made that up, because it doesn’t say on the box
I:    no
N:    or whether it says on the- on the later ones I mean I- I don’t erm,

      about- and it had Susan Saint James in it, she was the like, top
      actress in America and like, both of them were divorced, and had two
      children each, and they were all- they had to sort of house share, and

      kinda think, oh what the hell I’m just gonna blow fifty quid and s-
      see what happens, you know what I mean
N:    [laugh]
I:    you can see if it’s on youtube first
R:    yeah I could maybe do that

N:    I’ve never really been on youtube that much
I:    mm
N:    it’s f- it’s funny you saying about erm, not being as funny as it
      used to, we’ve erm, we got ‘Life of Brian’ you know Monty Python
I:    yeah,
N:    I don’t know if you’ve ever seen it
I:    yeah, I have
N:    but we- we- I think- I think I hype stuff up too much
I:    [laugh]
N:    cause I’m going, ‘ah, it’s great, it’s great, gotta watch this,
      [anon] it’s dead funny’ and [laugh] but when you put it on, then
      [anon] and [anon] are sat there like that

I:    just the life of Brian
N:    there was Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Life of Brian, [cough] and

TIME [45.00]
N:    Monty Python live at Drury Lane, I think they’re- they’re- they’re
      like the main ones, and they’re- and it was written by Eric Idle, I
      think Eric Idle wrote Spamalot, he was one of Monty Python, so he’s
      put a lot the, sort of ‘in-jokes’ in this
I:    mm
N:    and it’s- and it’s- it’s run a bit more like the Holy Grail
R:    mm
N:    sort of (0.5) storyline
R:    right
N:    of it but- but (0.5) so I th- you’ve- you’ve- you’ve got to know
      quite a few of the in j- you’ve- you- you’ve- you’ve got to have
      watched the DV- the- the film I think, to really enjoy it, although
      there’s- there’s certain things in it that we thought [anon], you
      know, he’d like that, and then when [anon]- you know, would find that
      funny
I:    yeah
N:    and different things but it was- it wasn’t (0.5) rib tickling
R:    no
N:    it wasn’t like, belly laugh out loud a minute,
R:    no
N:    all the way through it, but there was some, there were some bits in
