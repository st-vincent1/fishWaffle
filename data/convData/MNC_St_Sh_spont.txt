SB:   so we’ve got all these things just to discuss then?
I:    yeah [laugh]
SB:   that should be good, okay, let’s- let’s start with erm, (1.0) with-
with (2.5) [laugh]
SH:   what’s your best memory from when you were young Steph [anon]?
[laugh]
SB:   gosh, that’s a hard one to begin with [laugh]
SH:   [laugh]
SB:   my best memory from when I was young
SH:   or funniest
SB:   oh God
SH:   can you think of anything funny that happened to you? (2.0)
SB:   not funny, no (0.5) I’m r- I’m rubbish with a- [laugh] my memory
anyway
SH:   shall I tell you what one of my funny things was?
SB:   you’re best or funny memory, go on,
SH:   when erm, (0.5) I fell down all the steps at Blackpool going onto
      erm, the beach, some parts of Blackpool where it’s quite steep from
      sort of the, where the promenade is
SB:   oh yeah
SH:   and you sort of go down quite a lot of steps (0.5)
TIME [01.00]
SH:   and the way, sort of, the tide comes in, cos it’s quite a strong tide
      at Blackpool, isn’t it, there’d quite often at the bottom of the steps
      be quite big pools, and I can remember being really, it’s funny now
      but it wasn’t at the time
I:    [laugh]
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   but I can remember being really, you know, dressed up for the holiday
      with new shorts and a nice tee-shirt and everything, and went racing
      down these steps, and they were like wooden s- I can’t remember
      whether they were wooden or stone, but anyway, got towards the bottom
      and I slipped, and I went skidding and this puddle at the bottom was
      quite deep actually, cos obviously it was only sand, so it could wash
      away quite easily [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   I can remember sort of slipping into it all
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   and, it was like, bit muddy as well, not just sort of nice clean sand
SB:   how embarrassing [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   and I remember everyone looking at me, and me Dad picking me up and I
      was crying me eyes out a-
SB:   oh no
SH:   ah, they had to take me back to the hotel
SB:   oh, not good
SH:   so
SB:   I can remember a scary moment when I was younger, with me Dad driving
      when we’re on our way to Wales, you can imagine like, there was seven
      in a car
SH:   yeah
SB:   well, we had one of those like vans, you know, that you used to sit
TIME [02.00]
SB:   at the back of
SH:   yeah
SB:   it was a little sort of t- with a, erm, like a transit van but with-
      with seats in and well, (1.0) up to the hilt with luggage
I:    [laugh]
SH:   yeah
SB:   c- going- dest- to the Wales for the caravan (0.5) and it was in the
      days when obviously, there’s no motorway, it was all back roads
I:    mmhmm
SB:   and tiny little villages you had to go through, so me Dad decides to
      sort of like, ‘oh, I think I might go back this way, might be a
      shortcut’ can imagine, we’re going down a- and it was just the
      sheerest hill you have ever seen, and it- oh God, I- it wasn’t- it was
      really scary honestly, it was just- it was just me Mum’s like looking
      out, the side of the front,
I:    [laugh]
SB:   it was just like a sheer drop, he’d gone down this strange road,
      don’t know why he did, he thought it was a village
SH:   yeah
SB:   set to the village, and it wasn’t, it one of these country little
      lanes that just- but the road was just so, it was just steep like that
      it- you could hear him on the brakes going, [squeak]
I:    [laugh]
SB:   ah God, it was so- it’s funny now
SH:   really petrified
SB:   scary, it was scary at the time
SH:   yeah, well that’s like that one of mine, that-
SB:   yeah, oh it- it was really funny though
SH:   yeah that’s- [gasp] so he didn’t go that way again though
SB:   you should’ve heard me mother [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   [laugh]
SB:   I do remember that journey going to Wales
TIME [03.00]
SB:   that day yeah, that was a bit scary going down that
SH:   yeah, mm
SB:   really, re- he managed to do it fortunately but, didn’t go that way
      again no
SH:   I wonder where that was then
SB:   I don’t know it- I
SH:   Ruelt or somewhere like that
SB:   it was so- I was y- I was so young, I really wouldn’t remember
SH:   no
SB:   but yeah, it was do you know like all the old Flint, and you have to
      go through all the old
SH:   yeah, bet it was-
SB:   villages like that
SH:   yeah
SB:   it was before one of those, I ah, I couldn’t- I couldn’t believe how
      steep this little tiny road he decided to take us down was [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SB:   it was funny
SH:   and the brakes on the cars weren’t that good in those days either,
      not like now
SB:   but it was a big- I mean, it was like a big tranny van thing you
      know, with all us kids in the back with all the lugga- it was so fu- I
      don’t know how he managed it to be honest- I don’t know why we just
      didn’t-
SH:   oh God
SB:   and it was like turning down, no, not very nice (0.5) but that was-
      it was- it’s f- like as you say, it- f- it’s funny isn’t it how you
I:    mm
SB:   how you think back, you think, that was really scary at the time and
SH:   yeah
SB:   now you think, how funny, what th- how
SH:   I know
SB:   how funny that was [laugh]
SH:   I know
SB:   when you think about it now (2.5) [laugh]
SH:   and what, I think this is a good one, what kind of games did you
      play? And what- I bet we played similar sorts of things though
TIME [04.00]
SH:   cause it was in the street wasn’t it, just playing
SB:   in the street, yeah, we used to play like hopscotch, which was like
      the favourite one
SH:   yeah
SB:   wasn’t it and, ticky-hit and-
SH:   yeah
SB:   or kingy as we used to call it cos we used to play it with a ball
SH:   yeah
SB:   used to chuck a ball at somebody
SH:   somebody
SB:   and if you got them then obviously then they were it then (0.5) yeah
SH:   yeah, yeah
SB:   and elastics, I used to love elastics
SH:   oh we used to play that, we used to take those to school, cos you
      just used to buy l- big piece of elastic
SB:   yeah
I:    mm
SH:   on a card, (0.5) and just sort of un- unravel it didn’t you and then
      just tie the ends and everyone’d just be skipping
SB:   just be skipping along yeah
I:    [laugh]
SH:   yeah
SB:   yeah, I used to love elastics, yeah
SH:   yeah, we used to go to the park and play rounders a lot, everybody on
      the street just loadsa kids, cos there was loads of you
I:    yeah
SH:   just like on [anon] you know, and
SB:   yeah
SH:   you tended to play with the kids on your street
I:    mm
SH:   so like there were kids who all played together on the next street
SB:   yeah
SH:   and then occasionally you’d see them, but whenever you went anywhere
      you went with the kids who were like on your street
SB:   yeah, you didn’t really integrate really did you?
SH:   no
SB:   was that [anon] you used to go across to?
TIME [05.00]
SH:   we used to go across [anon]
SB:   yeah
SH:   either to [anon] or to [anon], which was at the back near the
      railway, erm
SB:   right, I don’t know that one
SH:   but yeah, it was [anon] more than anything and we used to play on the
      big field there
SB:   yeah cos you’re quite close there aren’t you, to that one
SH:   yeah, we used to take erm,
SB:   [laugh] (1.5)
SH:   I’m trying to think, it was probably a tennis racquet, so you could
      really whack the ball [laugh]
SB:   [laugh] ow
SH:   cause like you’d be running, [breathes]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   across- across the erm-
SB:   not quite rounders then [laugh]
SH:   like the little kiddies play area and then across the erm, bowling
      area, yeah, and I used to be able to really whack it, so we used to do
      that, and then we used to take erm, for the slide, cos it was quite a
      bit slide in [anon] so we used to take a piece of greaseproof paper, I
      bet [anon] thinks ‘God this sounds like’
SB:   yeah
I:    [laugh]
SH:   you know eh- sixty years ago
SB:   oh yeah, you had to, yeah to, yeah
SH:   but you used to- did you- do you know this?
I:    no
SH:   you used to sort of put it on your bottom
SB:   yeah, oh aye
SH:   used to sit on it and slide down the slide and it made the slide go
      faster
I:    yeah
SH:   so then the next person who was on it after that, it was like [noise]
SB:   yeah [laugh]
SH:   straight down
I:    [laugh]
SH:   really, really did-
SB:   grease it up
SH:   yeah
TIME [06.00]
SH:   really, yeah, really used to grease up the erm, the side
I:    [gasp] God
SH:   definitely
SB:   yeah
SH:   so we used to do that, and then erm, play on the erm, roundabout with
      a lolly stick didn’t you,
SB:   yeah
SH:   it’s so dangerous at the time, cos it was all concrete
I:    [laugh]
SB:   oh yeah, and they dropped it and you had to pick it up as you were on
      the way round, yeah
I:    [laugh]
SH:   so, so this thing, you know like, erm,
SB:   yeah, I remember that now
SH:   just like a roundabout that went round, the old fashioned type,
SB:   yeah, thrupenny bit they was called
SH:   but y-
SB:   or- or the spider even
SH:   yeah, the spider, we used to throw a lolly stick and then it-
      somebody would be going round, they’d get their sort of foot going and
      they’d run wouldn’t they and get it faster and faster and faster like
      that
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   and then you’d all jump on and they you used to hang on with one side
      and lean down
SB:   [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   and pick up as you whizzed past, try and pick up
SB:   try and get the lolly stick
SH:   a lolly stick and graze all you arm in the proceeds [laugh]
I:    oh no [laugh]
SB:   doing it [laugh]
SH:   no wonder I used to have so many headaches,
I:    [laugh]
SH:   I used to have erm,
SB:   that’s where your migraines are coming from [laugh]
SH:   [laugh] loadsa headaches doing all of that, so yeah, just loadsa time
      in the park really, just used to, in the holidays
SB:   it was the park yeah, you just used to
SH:   just go out for hours
SH:   and of course you didn’t have mobile phones and things so
SB:   yeah
I:    yeah
TIME [07.00]
SH:   but, I think your parents were glad to get rid of you really weren’t
they [laugh]
SB:   mm
I:    [laugh]
SB:   oh yeah, but I had to be in at a certain time
SH:   yeah
SB:   otherwise I’d really get (0.5) told off
SH:   oh yeah
SB:   you know, it was like half past nine and
SH:   yeah
SB:   if you’re not in (0.5) you’re in trouble [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   I don’t remember going out much in the evening though
SB:   no
SH:   to be honest
SB:   do you not? Oh yeah, we-
SH:   now whether we did and it was just summer and you just had, like, you
      say, you had to be back at a certain time (0.5)
SB:   yeah, she didn’t like us out being after dark
SH:   no
SB:   but yeah, summer time
SH:   but during the day in the school holidays you could-
SB:   oh during the day yeah, just anytime yeah
SH:   just take a bottle of something to drink
SB:   just came back when- when we were hungry like you do [laugh]
SH:   yeah
I:    [laugh]
SH:   yeah, that’s right
SB:   yeah, ‘feed me, I’m hungry now’ [laugh] (0.5) yeah
SH:   I don’t know many stories about my grandparents though,
SB:   no
SH:   I didn’t really know my grandparents very well, cos-
SB:   well I didn’t know one Granddad cos he died before me Mum got married
      even
SH:   yeah
SB:   her Dad died before she got married
SH:   so in terms of good stories (0.5)
SB:   I just know me Granddad was dead grumpy on me Dad’s side [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   was he
SB:   he used to call- yeah
TIME [08.00]
SB:   he- he- oh God, yeah, he used to just come, and he used to just come
      in and he’d- he would say, ‘hello’ you know, like, you haven’t got
      like- like the kids of today, they haven’t got the relationship with
      their
SH:   no
SB:   grandparents that we had, they were just these old people that just
      turned up and you just thought, ‘oh, okay’ [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SB:   [inc] and he’d sit down, and then he’d- he’d just say, ‘well, does
      anybody want one of these or what’ and it’s like, you know, y- your
      mints
SH:   yeah
SB:   and they’re stinking of mothballs out of his pocket
I:    eurgh
SB:   he used to always insist you have one of his mints
I:    [laugh]
SB:   ah, no (0.5) that was me Granddad on me Dad’s side,  can just- that’s
      all y- I remember about him, just being big grumpy man with smelly
      mints [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   oh right (0.5) I can remember my Granddad who lived next door to us
      on [anon] cos he used to put me on his shoulders and take me to the
      sweet shop
SB:   ahh
SH:   but I was- I was really young, and then he died, he was- day- died in
      an accident at work
SB:   mm
SH:   erm, and me Nanna lived a bit, you know, quite a, few years longer,
      but not, when I was, you know, older
I:    yeah
SH:   c- I was probably (0.5) probably about six then
SB:   oh right, yeah
SH:   but I ant- but my Granddad probably
TIME [09.00]
SH:   died when I was about three something like that, so I have really
      young memories of them
SB:   you have, yeah, cos my, yeah the person- the Granddad I’m talking
      about, I had- was thirteen when he died
SH:   yeah
SB:   so, again
SH:   yeah
SB:   it’s quite early really
SH:   it is it’s quite young
SB:   yeah
SH:   when you sort of think about, like, sort of [anon] and yourselves,
      you know
I:    mm
SH:   with your grandparents and the time you’ve spent with them
I:    yeah
SB:   yeah, it’s a longer time
SH:   yeah (0.5) so
SB:   and I can remember my Mum’s Mum she was very much like Mum, she was
      small lady, but she had one leg longer than the other and I can- and I
      can- all I can picture of her now is, erm, going through our living
      room into the kitchen, and there was like a doorway, and she just used
      to stand there and she was just swinging her leg back and forth
I:    [laugh]
SB:   she had to exercise her leg
SH:   [inc]
SB:   cause it used to get very stiff and very you know,
I:    mm
SB:   just sore
SH:   sore
SB:   and- and- and ache really, more of an ache
SH:   yeah
SB:   she used to have built up shoes, her shoe- her other shoe like- was
      like the- the heel, bit like platforms I suppose nowadays
SH:   yeah, yeah
SB:   but they- the- the- the sole and the heels were like massive
SH:   and was it just on one? On- yeah
SB:   just one leg,
SH:   on one leg, mm
SB:   she had one leg about four inches shorter than the other
SH:   yeah
SB:   and I can just remember she used to always come to
TIME [10.00]
SB:   the house and she use to always s- stand in the doorway and she was
      always in the kitchen doorway and leg would be swinging back and
      forth, back and forth, for- for ages she’d just be stood there
I:    [laugh]
SH:   mm
SB:   so that’s just the memory of my Gran that I have, it’s weird isn’t
      it, how you just
SH:   yeah
SB:   nothing really else, we didn’t do anything with her, she just came to
      the house and perhaps we had tea and- but I just can see her, stood
      there,
SH:   yeah
SB:   swinging her leg
SH:   we- we never saw much of me Mum’s side, even if you know, it was her
      Mum and me Mum’s Dad died before I was born, because me Mum always
      said, ooh, they lived a long way away, you know
SB:   ahh
SH:   ‘oh yeah, they li- they live a long way’ and when you think about it
      now, it was only the other side of Manchester
I:    really
SH:   but because me Mum didn’t drive
SB:   yeah, it just seemed a long way
I:    mm
SH:   me Dad did have a car, there’d be occasions when he didn’t have a car
SB:   mm
SH:   I think, cos they were older cars and if it failed its MOT or the
      equivalent of the MOT
I:    yeah
SH:   I think you just have to sell it, and that was it, you didn’t have a
      car for a while [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SB:   I know
SH:   and then you saved up and you bought another one, erm, so
TIME [11.00]
SH:   me Dad had a car but he’d be using that for work anyway, erm, and me
      Mum didn’t drive, and then I suppose, she then got sort of a part time
      job when we were at school, so I suppose they just didn’t have the
      time and it-
SB:   no, they probably didn’t
I:    mm
SH:   you know, it would’ve been probably two buses
SB:   yeah
I:    yeah
SH:   to get there
SB:   it’s a long- long journey
I:    mm
SH:   but erm, so yeah, I don’t think it was that far away, we’d just jump
      in the car and drive there now
I:    yeah
SH:   but to them it was sort of
SB:   major sort of
SH:   yeah
SB:   day out really
SH:   yeah
SB:   wasn’t it
SH:   so we just seemed to see more of my Dad’s side of the family because
      they all lived in Stretford
I:    nearby, mm
SB:   mm
SH:   or Sale, you know, they were all sort of like within the vicinity if
      you know what I mean
SB:   I think you find that anyway don’t you, some, more often
SH:   yeah, so you tend to sort of find that, and I’ve only one
      recollection of me Mum’s Mum (0.5) erm, and again, I must’ve been
      really, really, young and I can remember she kept saying, ‘she’s gonna
      hurt herself, she’s gonna hurt herself, grab hold of her’ I think at-
      she must’ve had a cellar and the door must’ve been open
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   and I just have this vague recollection of seeing steps going down
SB:   mm
TIME [12.00]
SH:   downstairs which I’d never seen before cos we didn’t have a cellar at
      our house, so I just must’ve been mesmerised by these steps [laugh]
SB:   by the steps
I:    [laugh]
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   and possibly they didn’t have- she didn’t have a door on it
I:    yeah
SH:   and she was trying to keep me away, and I can remember her saying
      something to me Mum like, (0.5) I think these were her words, ‘you’ve
      got your hands full with her’
I:    [laugh]
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   ‘ooh, you’ve got your hands full with that one’ [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   I must’ve been a bit
SB:   you must’ve done
SH:   you know,
SB:   frightening her
SH:   a bit hyper or something like that (0.5)
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   did you ever get hurt whilst you were playing as a kid? Well, we’ve
      covered that haven’t we in terms of like, the games you used to play
SB:   yeah, I did get hurt beca- I remember- I remember playing erm,
SH:   yeah
SB:   well, I- I think it was just something I- I was doing meself, it
      wasn’t a game that any- I had erm, a broom pole, you know the hand-
      the- the brush bit had come off the broom
SH:   yeah
SB:   so I just had th- the pole bit, and I remember rolling it, I don’t
      know why, I just remember rolling it in front of me and then deciding
      to jump over it (0.5) and of course, in my haste to try and jump over
      it, I’d rolled it, and I didn’t clear it, and I put me foot on it
TIME [13.00]
SB:   and of course, rolled with it
SH:   mm
SB:   and I just remember going right back and banging
SH:   ooh
I:    [gasp]
SB:   my head so hard on the concrete, I can remember doing that, such a
      lump came up
I:    ooh
SB:   but I remember that’s- that’s the only time I’ve really hurt myself,
      I’ve never like broken any bones,
I:    mm
SH:   no
SB:   I’ve never- touch wood, I’ve never broken a leg, broken an arm
SH:   yeah
SB:   you know, had anything in plaster,
SH:   yeah
SB:   or you know, slashed meself or anything
SH:   no
SB:   or cuts and bruises, I just remember, I don’t know how old- in fact
      it was before we moved into Stretford so I must’ve only been about
      six, five or six
SH:   yeah
SB:   I just remembered it, but isn’t it funny cos I can remember that
      though cos it blooming
SH:   you can remember that, and going backwards and really banging your
      head
SB:   yeah, and really banging me head, yeah and cos like, you know, me
      [cry] crying me eyes out, coming running in, ‘what’ve you done,
      what’ve you done’ [laugh]
SH:   [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SB:   so of course, like, you know, lying there and then she thinks I’ve
      got concussion then,
I:    [laugh]
SB:   [inc] ‘you mustn’t go to sleep’ you know, ‘you must stay awake’
SH:   ‘wake up’
SB:   ‘wake up’ [laugh]
SH:   ‘wake up, stay awake, stay awake’ I can remember, [anon], erm being
      knocked out by a swing
I:    really?
SH:   in [anon],
SB:   mm
SH:   me Mum was with us, and erm, she’d taken us- she’d obviously taken us
      to the park and [anon] was probably about
TIME [14.00]
SH:   about three, something like that, so I’m three years older than her,
      so I’m six
I:    mm
SH:   and erm, I can just picture it now, where the swings were and she
      just ran, and a swing that somebody- a kiddy was on came forward
SB:   mm, just forward
I:    oh
SH:   and sort of whacked her on her forehead and knocked- literally
      knocked her out, she- she
SB:   she would’ve done, yeah
SH:   passed out with it and I can re- Mum- member me Mum sort of really
      shouting and picking her up and (0.5) like, holding her in her arms,
      and running erm, onto [anon] cos there’s a doc- there’s still a
      doctor’s surgery there anyway
I:    mm
SH:   but there was one that backed onto the park
SB:   ah
SH:   and she ran out of the gates, and I’m running after her and she’s
      going, ‘come on, keep up’ [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   she’s running
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   and she just went flying into the doctor’s surgery
SB:   oh Lord
SH:   I think she’d come round by that time,
SB:   yeah
I:    yeah
SH:   but she’s still got the scar [anon]
I:    really?
SH:   if you look, a very little scar just on her head where the things
      just-
SB:   where it’s hit her
SH:   yeah, cos they were wood weren’t they in the main
SB:   they were wood, yeah
SH:   sort of wooden seats, so I think it just sort of
SB:   yeah, they were quite heavy
I:    yeah
SH:   swung out, so, yeah,
SB:   just caught her
SH:   I can remember that being really, really scary
SB:   I can imagine (0.5)
TIME [15.00]
SH:   (4.0) did you ever get into trouble for something at school?
SB:   get into trouble
SH:   I was quite good really
SB:   no, I was- I was good unfortunately
I:    [laugh]
SB:   yeah,
SH:   I can remember getting into trouble-
SB:   we did play truant once, it was our [anon] doing
SH:   ah
SB:   ‘let’s- let’s have the day off’ and we got caught straight away
      [laugh] [inc] we got back [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SB:   it didn’t- it didn’t work somehow
SH:   [laugh] think, ‘you know what, we won’t- we won’t do that again’
      [laugh]
SB:   no, no
SH:   so who caught you?
SB:   I’d- I think [anon] must’ve written a note that wasn’t very good
      [laugh] I don’t know
SH:   [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SB:   I don’t think she’s a very good forger of the erm, the old signature
      though [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   [laugh] didn’t pass then
SB:   so erm, no, we’d gone into town, we’d spent the day in town, I don’t
      know why, she just decided ‘let’s not go to school’, so erm, so we
      didn’t, s- no, but I- yeah, we got called into erm, the headmistresses
      office (0.5) so it wasn’t good [laugh]
SH:   [laugh]
SB:   I didn’t get totally told off, I mean it was our erm, first offence
I:    [laugh]
SB:   erm, but
SH:   ahh
SB:   erm, it was a bit scary so she made me go to the teacher
TIME [16.00]
SB:   that I was in the class of next, you know, when I was going, and then
      erm, she says, ‘you’re gonna have to go and explain now, to the
      teacher now, why you weren’t in school yesterday’ [laugh] and it was
      dead embarrassing cos it was the- it had to be the teacher that you
      fancied didn’t it
I:    oh no [laugh]
SB:   it was the Biology teacher [laugh]
SH:   is that- what
SB:   and everybody fancied the Biology teacher
SH:   oh no
SB:   he was lovely (0.5) and he was my form teacher at the time and I had
      to go an explain to him why I wasn’t in school [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SB:   the previous day, I didn’t
SH:   oh, that’s awful isn’t it
SB:   I didn’t, I- I- I cowered out of that (0.5) I just said, ‘ooh, I’ve
      been to see the headmistress, I’ve gotta come join the class now’
      [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   ahh, I can remember getting into-
SB:   but I wasn’t, yeah- I wasn’t n- I wasn’t a troublemaker
SH:   no, I can remember, only two things really, one of them was Sunday
      school, and it wasn’t about being naughty it was about (0.5) turning
      something down that I was asked to do because I was shy and it- I was
      asked to be Mary in the nativity play at Sunday school
I:    ahh
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   and it just scared me so much
TIME [17.00]
SH:   wa- having to walk down the aisle, cos that- they always did it, not
      erm, we used to go to Sunday school in the church hall, but the actual
      nativity play always took place in the church
SB:   mm
SH:   and I can remember watching it meself and Mary and Joseph would walk
      down the aisle, and I can remember thinking, ‘I’m not walking down the
      aisle with a boy’
I:    [laugh]
SH:   ‘holding a baby doll (0.5) holding Jesus’
SB:   [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   and the- just the thought of it
SB:   what, the starring part as well [laugh]
SH:   yeah, it scared me so much
I:    ahh
SH:   so I just said, no I didn’t wanna do it, thinking nothing of it
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   but cos Mum and Dad also went to church as well, and knew the Sunday
      school teachers, they told her
I:    [laugh]
SH:   the following, you know, sh- or she told them the following week,
      they said, ‘ooh, we’ve asked Shona [anon] to be erm, Mary and she’s-
      she’s said no’
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   and I can remember when I got home, Mum and Dad went mad with me
I:    did they
SH:   they said, ‘fancy turning that down you had- you could’ve had the
      starring role’
I:    [laugh]
SH:   I said, ‘but I didn’t want the starring role, I-’ in fact all I kept
      thinking about all the time was wanting to be an angel, cos I wanted
      somebody to do those big wings
SB:   [laugh]
TIME [18.00]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   and put them on me back, and I fancied being- cos it was all nice,
      and white, and pretty wasn’t it, and so Mary just had a-
SB:   the angels? Yeah, and they didn’t really do much, they just stood
      there, looking pretty
SH:   Mary had a horrible blue sort of, like, tea-towely looking dress on
      [laugh]
SB:   [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   and, you know, Mary, dark blue, stripes, Angel, white, wings
SB:   yeah, strange thing on your head [laugh]
SH:   [laugh] no-one’s- I wanted to be the an- I
I:    it- you can see why
SH:   yeah, I wouldn’t- and I wouldn’t’ve minded being erm, Gabriel,
      something like that
SB:   so did they think you were very ungrateful then and not-
SH:   they thought I was really ungrateful because they’d actually chosen
      me cos, you know, they thought I could
SB:   mm
SH:   carry it off and
SB:   mm [laugh]
SH:   so I can remember my Mum and Dad really telling me off, and then the
      other time I can remember being in trouble was, erm, when I was at
      grammar school, and we erm, rather than go out through the doors, we d-
       opened all the windows and climbed out
I:    [laugh]
SH:   not realising that, as you climbed out, it was only our first year,
      the erm staff room was sort of at right angles to where the main
      classrooms were,
I:    oh no
SH:   so of course all the teachers
TIME [19.00]
SH:   were sat eating their lunch
SB:   [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   saw these legs come out of the window [laugh]
SB:   oh, good Lord
SH:   and we all climb out onto the tennis- you know where- cos the tennis
      courts were just below
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   cause it was a really long walk round
SB:   mm
SH:   and down onto the field
SB:   so you’d just taken a shortcut
I:    [laugh]
SH:   so we thought, ‘we’ll take a shortcut’ (1.0) so erm, yeah I can
      remember having to restack, you know all those stackable chairs
I:    ooh
SH:   they used to be really heavy with like canvas seats in those days
SB:   oh yeah, and those iron legs
SH:   with the- with the metal frames
SB:   mm
SH:   we had to (0.5) erm, there was probably about four, five of us who
      had done it (0.5) and they got us all in, so we had a detention, and
      we had to restack all the chairs in the hall [laugh] that-
SB:   ooh, punishment [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   so, but that was it, so it was nothing particularly exciting
I:    yeah
SH:   we’re not really naughty
SB:   no, no
I:    that’s [inc]
SH:   but erm, but no I was really, really embarrassed and I can remember
      my friend who also did it at, you know, the same time (0.5) and erm,
      (1.0) we were sort of (1.0) told off really
SB:   mm
SH:   erm, at registration I think in the afternoon
TIME [20.00]
SH:   you know, lunch, after lunch, erm, I think we were in the, our
      classroom then, or form room was the music room and I can remember we
      were up there, with sort of, one of the music teachers, and she said,
      ‘five girls who will remain nameless’
I:    [laugh]
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   so I’m looking up thinking, ‘I’m not going to look guilty, cos they
      won’t know who it is, so I’m just’ (0.5)
I:    [laugh]
SH:   and me friend was at the side of me, who’d also been caught, and she
      just sat there crying her eyes out
I:    [laugh]
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   I thought, ‘well, you’re making it really obvious’
I:    [laugh]
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   cause she’s going [sniff] blowing her nose
SB:   ah, guilty as charged [laugh]
SH:   but yeah we were- we were really embarrassed that we’d been naughty,
      whereas (1.0) you know, probably now,
SB:   wouldn’t care
SH:   kids’d just think, ‘oh, I’m just climbing out the window, wasn’t
      doing anything’
I:    [laugh]
SB:   yeah
SH:   but really mortifed the fact that we’d done something wrong, whether
      it was because it was the first year (1.0) and we didn’t know everyone
      that well
SB:   and you didn’t like to be thought that you were gonna be like that
      kind of
SH:   a troublemaker
SB:   troublemaker, yeah
I:    mm
SB:   you just think, ‘oh, I’m scarred now, they’re gonna just think I’m
      like that all the time’ [laugh]
I:    yeah
SH:   yeah (0.5)
TIME [21.00]
SH:   yeah
SB:   [laugh] (4.5) least teachers, hmm (2.5)
SH:   your hometown (0.5) well, I’ve certainly not lived anywhere else,
      you’ve not have you (0.5) lived in Manchester
SB:   not in town wise, no, Manchester, yeah
SH:   well, where were your parents from Steph [anon]
SB:   erm, [anon]
SH:   were they both from Manchester?
SB:   yeah, me Dad used to, yeah, he was from [anon] (0.5) erm, and me Mum
      was from down South, [anon] way [clears throat]
SH:   oh was she? I didn’t know that
SB:   we- yeah, she didn’t live there very long
SH:   she come up North
SB:   come up North, then, yeah
SH:   yeah
SB:   so she met me Dad and then they just, yeah, it was erm, [anon] they
      sort of settled in, so
SH:   yeah (0.5) yeah my Mum was from [anon] (0.5) and my Dad was from
      [anon]
I:    oh (0.5)
SH:   but then, his family moved to [anon] (0.5) cos it was posh then
SB:   well it was, yeah it was a posh place to come to, yeah
SH:   from [anon], cos [anon] was low key and dirty
I:    yeah
SH:   and [anon] was
TIME [22.00]
SH:   still a suburb then wasn’t it
SB:   mm (0.5) oh yeah
SH:   erm, so
SB:   it was a more well to do place to move to
SH:   yeah, so me Dad’s family moved there, and (1.5) I think my Dad had
      just met me Mum just before they moved, and then me Mum and Dad bought
      the house next door to
I:    yeah
SH:   erm, my Dad’s Mum and Dad
I:    ahh
SH:   so, they were like sort of, living next door to each other
SB:   mm
I:    u- up until fairly recently when the house had st- my Aunt- me
      Grandma’s house, me Nanna’s house had stayed in the same family, it
      was erm, her daughter and husband who ended up living in the house,
      and then me Mum had been there for a long, long time
I:    mm
SH:   she’d been there for about forty years, so me Mum and her sister-in-
      law were still living there
SB:   oh right (0.5)
SH:   so, all those years later
SB:   [cough] mm
SH:   me Mum said, ‘and I never liked it, I never wanted to live there’
I:    [laugh]
SH:   and she lived there for forty years [laugh]
SB:   long time
SH:   I don’t think people sort of, tended to move did they, they sort of
      tended (0.5) to stay in the same house
SB:   not really no, we had to move from Old Trafford cos our house was
      being demolished
TIME [23.00]
SB:   [clears throat] so we had no choice
SH:   oh you did didn’t you
SB:   [clears throat] yeah, they pulled down our houses
SH:   yeah, big houses
SB:   so erm,
SH:   big terraced houses
SB:   they were terraced houses yeah, yeah, big rooms, but erm, it’s- but
      it wasn’t really big enough for us because like me Mum used to use the
      front parlour, as it were then, as a- a bedroom
SH:   oh right
SB:   erm, so
SH:   so is it still just three bedroom?
SB:   still three bedrooms, yeah, so it was- and with- with being like, you
      know, two lads, two girls and (1.0) it was a bit cramped
SH:   yeah
SB:   that was before [anon] came along, [anon] came along after we moved
      you see [laugh]
SH:   ahh
SB:   so erm,
SH:   so did you- you s- your other house, the house your Mum and Dad lived
      in when I met you, (0.5) did that seem a lot bigger when you got
      there?
SB:   it was a lot bigger, and of course, we had the garden which was like,
      marvellous, you know, we only had a little yard before
SH:   yeah
SB:   and the outside toilet (0.5) so, to have a bathroom and a garden, it
      was like a palace wasn’t it [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   yeah
SB:   it was lovely, although it was very different, what y- how you
      remember the house, it was very different when we first moved in
SH:   yeah
TIME [24.00]
SB:   because there was- there was two rooms
SH:   yeah, cos it was quite open plan, your Mum- they’d knocked it through
      hadn’t they
SB:   yeah, they’d knocked down quite a few walls, erm, when we first moved
      in that house it was like one of these where you- you go through one
      door and you’re in- in the front room, you go through another door and
      you’re in the dining area, you go through another door and you’re in
      the kitchen, and then you come back in this door, and you’re back in
      the hall
SH:   yeah
SB:   so as kids we used to drive my Mum mental,
SH:   just running
SB:    just running (0.5) round, chasing each other
I:    [laugh]
SB:   round and round all these doors, it was great [laugh]
SH:   [laugh] hiding from each other? ‘Where’s she gone?’
SB:   just- just- just chasing
I:    [laugh]
SB:   just- just playing ticky-hit round the doors [laugh]
SH:   oh God
SB:   she’d go mad with us
SH:   yeah, yeah
SB:   but it was just so much space you know, just
SH:   yeah
SB:   even though the rooms were, like-
SH:   I was gonna say, the rooms probably wouldn’t be that much bigger
      than, no
SB:   no, the room- the rooms weren’t too bad
SH:   no
SB:   but, it was just the fact that we could- we could just utilise each
      room, you know
SH:   yeah
SB:   before like, we were just stuck in one room in the back
SH:   mm
SB:   and when you say big rooms they were- they were- I don’t think it was
      probably as big as your Mum’s perhaps [inc]
SH:   oh, it wasn’t, no
SB:   it didn’t- (0.5) it was- it would probably the same as this room
TIME [25.00]
SB:   you know, blocked off here but not per-
SH:   mm
SB:   quite as wide
SH:   yeah
SB:   they- they looked bigger from the outside than they did
SH:   yeah, sometimes, cos they’re higher,
SB:   yeah
SH:   they’re sort of deceptive aren’t they, yeah
SB:   the front bedroom was enormous, where [anon] and I had the front
      bedroom, and that was a massive great big room
SH:   yeah
SB:   but then you’d got like erm, smaller room at the back
SH:   everything’s sorta smaller after that
SB:   yeah
SH:   yeah (0.5)
SB:   but, it was- I mean, we were only young then so I suppose they seemed
      bigger
SH:   seems bigger
SB:   anyway to what I- I- they probably were
SH:   yeah
SB:   no, but we loved erm, we loved it when we moved to Stretford, it was
      the bees knees then [laugh]
SH:   yeah (0.5)
SB:   I remember getting lost though, I was supposed to- cos we’d not moved
      schools at that point, and we were still at [anon]
SH:   yeah
SB:   there at [anon] there and I was supposed to wait for our [anon] (0.5)
      to come and pick me up, I’ve probably told you this story, I had to
      wait for our [anon] to bring me to the new house
I:    yeah
SB:   cause it was like from [anon] it’s a bus drive
SH:   quite a long way for kiddies isn’t it
SB:   yeah
SH:   from [anon] to
I:    mm
SB:   when you think of it now, it’s just like five
TIME [26.00]
SB:   ten minutes down the road but,
SH:   yeah
SB:   to me it was like, you know, it was like
SH:   no, it’s a long way
SB:   miles
SH:   yeah
I:    [laugh]
SB:   it was like an hours journey [laugh]
SH:   when really you only went to school like, down at the end of the
      street, or round the corner didn’t you
SB:   exactly, yeah (0.5) so of course, I came out of school, and I’m sat
      there on the wall thinking, ‘ooh, where is he’ (0.5) course, when
      you’re a kiddy, like, five minutes is an hour
I:    yeah
SB:   so I’m thinking, ‘oh, he’s not here, he’s not- he’s gone without me,
      where is he, where is he’ so I’m wandering off to the shops, you know,
      on- on, erm
SH:   yeah
SB:   the main- the main shops where I remembered I c- I can find me way to
      (1.5) and I’m thinking, right, I’ve got here, now what do I do’
      [laugh] I hadn’t a clue where I was, I didn’t know where I’ve got to
      go to
SH:   no
SB:   I couldn’t- I didn’t know how to get home, I knew where I lived,
SH:   mm, mm
SB:   she’d given me the address to write, put in me pocket
I:    mm
SB:   hadn’t a clue how to get there, so I go in the shop, ‘I’m lost, I’m
      lost’
I:    [laugh]
SB:   ‘me brother’s not come for me’
SH:   [laugh] oh no
SB:   ‘I don’t know where I am’, I’m crying me eyes out, this poor woman in
      this shop being like ‘what’
I:    [laugh]
SH:   [laugh]
SB:   so of course, they phone up the police, don’t they
I:    oh no
SB:   so I get to go home in a police car
I:    [laugh]
SH:   ooh, I didn’t know
TIME [27.00]
SH:   about that’s one thing you’ve never told me
SB:   shocking, shocking, no, it’s shocking (0.5) no, I hadn’t a clue where
      I was but I could tell him where I lived so, there we are
I:    [laugh]
SB:   I’m in the police car, taking me home (1.0) get to the front door,
      and our [anon] gets a right bollocking off me Mum [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SB:   ‘why didn’t you wait for your daughter st- your sister to come out of
      school?’, ‘I did, I did, I did, she wasn’t there, I got there and she
      wasn’t there’, so funny
SH:   ahh
SB:   so, no, we kinda both got told off [laugh]
SH:   [laugh]
SB:   but he- it was c- shame, cos he was only like, you know, he was only
      f- four years older than me
SH:   I was gonna say, it’s ea- it’s easy to forget isn’t it when you’re a
      kiddy anyway
SB:   yeah,
SH:   yeah
SB:   cause that was it, I’d be only what, I’d be seven when I moved
SH:   yeah (0.5)
SB:   so (0.5) really that’s a ch- it is still a child, isn’t it, seven,
      wandering around the streets on your own [laugh]
SH:   oh God it is, yeah
SB:   and he was, s- seven, eight, n- he was only- he’d only be eleven, so
      he wasn’t much older
SH:   yeah, so it’s still only young isn’t it
I:    [laugh]
SB:   it’s a big responsibility then for an eleven year old to try and get
      your sister
SH:   it’s easy to sort of, forget these things
SB:   yeah
SH:   yeah
SB:   it was so funny, like, yeah, got, yeah, got sent home, so I- I always
      think now that’s why I have a fear of getting lost
I:    mm
SB:   because I remember being
TIME [28.00]
SB:   in that place, not knowing where the heck I was, and it was- is-
SH:   mm
SB:   it’s just a horrible feeling of just (1.0) oh
SH:   what do I do (0.5)
SB:   where am I, you know, I-
SH:   yeah
SB:   I don’t know how to get from here to where I need to be, and I’m
      still like that, if I’m in the car and I’m
I:    yeah
SB:   driving and I take a wrong turn I panic (0.5) something terrible
SH:   oh it must- yeah,
SB:   I’m shocking
SH:   it must me associated with that, yeah
SB:   I’ve cried before now when I’ve come off the motorway at the wrong
      junction, (0.5) cried, [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SB:   where am I going, and I’m crying me eyes out, cos I don’t know where
      I’m going [laugh]
SH:   [laugh]
SB:   and I’ve to find meself back on meself, scare meself to death
SH:   oh right, no I- you see I don’t get scared I just think,
SB:   I’m useless, absolutely useless
SH:   ‘oh well’
I:    yeah
SB:   yeah
SH:   carry on a bit further and (0.5) it’ll all make sense
I:    [laugh]
SB:   mm
SH:   and I’m sure I’ll find where I am, and you usually do don’t you, y-
      cos you sort of think- you see another sign or whatever
SB:   probably do yeah, well I- I do anyway, if I do go off the beaten
      track, you do kind of- but I just
SH:   yeah, but that’s probably why, probably goes back to then doesn’t it
SB:   yeah, I just have this, such a fear of having to go anywhere on my
      own and then not (0.5) being able to find meself (0.5) where I need to
      go if I do
SH:   mm
SB:   sort of take the wrong turning, or
SH:   mm
TIME [29.00]
SB:   get on the wrong train, that f- (1.0) that’s our [anon] you see, when
      we went to Liverpool we got on the- we went- well, we got to
      Liverpool, we were supposed to be going to Wales (1.0) we got on the
      wrong train
I:    [laugh] oh no
SB:   we were supposed to be going to Wales and we get on this train and we
      end up in Liverpool (0.5) so again, that was like, (0.5) ‘oh God,
      where are we, why are we here’
SH:   [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SB:   [anon] at it, ‘don’t worry, don’t worry, we’ll find our way, we’ll
      find our way’
SH:   ‘well sort it, we’ll sort it’
SB:   but it’s again, it’s like I’m in the middle of this place thinking,
      ‘oh my God’ [laugh] ‘well, what train do we get now’
SH:   yeah, well you sound as though you were a bit more adventurous and
      had to go further, whereas I was always just around Stretford if you
      know what I mean
I:    mm
SH:   didn’t really (0.5) go very far
SB:   go anywhere (1.0)
SH:   and I think, looking at that one there-
SB:   you’re making up for it now you see there [laugh]
SH:   making up for it now (1.0) things about, how has community and things
      changed, I think when we were younger, apart from you going off to
      Liverpool [laugh]
I:    laugh]
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   and not getting home, erm, was everything was around your own little
      area wasn’t it?
SB:   yeah (1.0) it was really yeah, it- it was close
SH:   e- everything you did was sort of like
I:    yeah
SB:   close knit
SH:   I mean, w- with me it was sort of like, there was [anon], the school
      at the end, the church,
TIME [30.00]
SB:   yeah
SH:   the park
SB:   you didn’t even have to get a bus really did you
SH:   the shops
SB:   mm
SH:   every- everything was
I:    already in the road really
SH:   you know, we, yeah, we used to go up to the precinct when that
      opened, but that’s only about [laugh] f- fifteen minute walk
SB:   [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   but that was- that was going- well that was, yeah, that was sort of,
      quite a distance
SB:   again, that’s close isn’t it?
SH:   but we’d go shopping in Manchester, so we’d get- either go in the car
      or get the bus into Manchester, with my Mum and Dad, you know when we
      were
SB:   mm
SH:   used to go to C and A for your new clothes
I:    [laugh]
SH:   so it was all, C- C and A, erm, or Altrincham sometimes we used to
      get the bus to Altrincham, but it was mainly town, but other than that
SB:   mm
SH:   just going for things like that
I:    yeah
SH:   you know, sort of clothes for holidays and things, it was generally
      just everything around where you lived
SB:   where you lived, it was always, yeah (0.5) but then there wasn’t the
      (0.5) the choice then was there, you know what I mean
SH:   no
SB:   you didn’t have like, things like the Trafford Centre or (0.5) I
      mean, the- the- they hadn’t even got the Arndale, they built that
      after we’d moved, it was still Kings Street with all the little shops
      on it
SH:   oh yeah, yeah
TIME [31.00]
SH:   I can remember that, sort of the, you know, the old shops along Kings
      Street
SB:   so when they- yeah
SH:   that’s right (0.5) and then the precinct was built
SB:   [inc]
SH:   sort of, probably around the time you moved then wasn’t it
SB:   must’ve been, yeah
SH:   yeah (0.5) but we, erm, (0.5) we were always doing stuff for the
      church in terms of erm, (1.0) delivering Christian Aid envelopes, and
      collecting jumble, and, so
SB:   oh really, yeah, so
SH:   yeah, just loads of our time,
SB:   just, with your church
SH:   just sort of spent doing things like that
I:    mm
SH:   and then my Dad did erm, (1.0) quite a bit for the Summer Fair and
      then the Christmas Fair (0.5) and I can remember one year, I don’t
      know whether I’ve told you this, we’d had a Christmas Fair, and then
      he decided, for the next Christmas Fair he was gonna make this really
      good grotto on the stage in the church hall (1.0) and he decided he
      was going to go to [anon], cos we’d been there as kids, you know, to
      see Father Christmas
SB:   mm
SH:   cause it was always the best place to see Father Christmas, [anon],
      wasn’t it?
SB:   oh yeah, it was, in them days, yeah, we used to go to-
I:    mm
SH:   you always got a really nice gift at the end of it
TIME [32.00]
SB:   used to go to town, yeah, Christmas [laugh]
I:    yeah
SH:   and me Dad sort of decided he was gonna go up there and try and get a-
       have a word with one of the managers and ask, could he, erm, take
      away some parts of the grotto
I:    oh
SH:   and rebuild it in miniature (1.0)
SB:   oh right [laugh]
SH:   very miniature
SB:   very miniature, for the ch-
SH:   on the stage
SB:   oh right, for the- [laugh]
SH:   erm, so he did and it was all like polystyrene sort of things, and
      anyway he built this sort of little thing that Father Christmas sat
      inside the following year [laugh]
SB:   [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   and everything, I can remember him bringing these bits back, bit-by-
      bit in his car, cos he only had a car
I:    [laugh]
SH:   his little building blocks, and erm, storing them underneath the
      stage at the erm, church hall, in [anon]
SB:   oh, good grief
SH:   and then the following Christmas he got them all out, and built this
      thing up [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   and, cos somebody dressed up, not him, he never dressed up, somebody
      dressed   up as Father Christmas and that was our little-
SB:   and that was your grotto [laugh]
SH:   [anon] grotto [laugh]
I:    ahh, that’s nice
SH:   so it was always sorta things like that really (1.0) so nothing too
      exciting, but
TIME [33.00]
SH:   oh and brownies, were you in brownies? (0.5)
SB:   erm, for about two weeks [laugh]
I:    [laugh] why
SH:   [laugh] you st- [laugh] why was it only for that long?
SB:   I j- I just thought it was really b- I think it must’ve been the
      brownies where we were going to
I:    mm
SH:   yeah, I think it depends on, yeah
SB:   it just wasn’t being run, I don’t think
SH:   no
SB:   as a Brownie
SH:   was it boring?
SB:   it was
SH:   yeah
SB:   yeah, it was terrible
I:    [laugh]
SB:   I just thought, why am I coming here, it’s- I’d go pff,
SH:   [inc]
SB:   I can’t remember now what- why, if you ask me now
SH:   yeah
SB:   what- how it was boring, but I just remember going, and thinking
      ‘right, that’s about it’ [laugh] ‘I’ve given in two weeks’ [laugh]
I:    [laugh] (1.0)
SH:   can remember erm, the badges, I was mesmerised by the ba- badges, and
      I- I wanted to be- I had this fixation [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   being an angel, there was fairies, I wanted to be a fairy
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   cause that was the prettiest badge
I:    [laugh]
SH:   it was the nicest girliest badge, and I wasn’t, I was an imp
I:    [laugh]
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   [laugh]
SB:   oh right,
SH:   cos they just select you for whatever
I:    yeah
SH:   and they go, ‘oh you’re-’
SB:   oh as your group?
SH:   ‘you’re imps’ yeah (0.5) and then I can remember years ago
TIME [34.00]
SH:   (0.5) what was it called, we never had these when we were there, ‘the
      gillydoos’
I:    yeah
SH:   what the hell were ‘the gillydoos’, it was all imps and pixies and
      fairies when I was there
SB:   oh
SH:   when [anon] went many, you know
SB:   mm
SH:   obviously, years later, and probably when you were there [anon]
I:    yeah
SB:   what the hecks a ‘gillydoo’
SH:   there was a (0.5) what they called, a- a six
I:    yeah, that’s right
SH:   a six called the gillydoos, I never heard of a gillydoo (0.5)
SB:   don’t know what that is
SH:   no, so anyway, I want- wanted to be erm, in the fairies [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   it’s a good job I wasn’t a bloke [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   erm, (1.5) but I was an imp
I:    oh
SB:   oh dear, never mind
SH:   but erm,
SB:   well you stuck it out anyway, longer than me
I:    [laugh] [inc]
SH:   but no, I did stick it out so it must’ve been quite well run
SB:   yeah
SH:   but again, that was in the church, every- everything was- everything
      that
I:    [laugh]
SH:   my whole life, if I- if it- if they did it in the church hall, you
      went to it
SB:   mm, yeah
SH:   yeah (2.0) and then me Dad did bingo, he used to do bingo for OAPs
SB:   did he? [laugh]
SH:   yeah (0.5) and he got the old bingo machine from the [anon] when they
      updated theirs
TIME [35.00]
SB:   really
SH:   he was always on the c-
I:    [laugh]
SB:   he’s on- he’s always on the
SH:   he’s always on the catch
SB:   on the look out, yeah, on the catch
SH:   yeah [laugh]
SB:   for stuff [laugh]
SH:   yeah, yeah at- cos at first he did it sort of all home made, with
      erm, just sort of blocks with
SB:   yeah
SH:   you know, you pull things out of the bag, and then eventually had
      like a machine where it popped out
SB:   ooh, proper rolling one [laugh]
I:    oooh [laugh]
SH:   bit like on the l- national lottery [laugh]
SB:   [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   it’s still working but obviously a bit old fashioned
I:    yeah
SH:   but erm, no everybody, I think they thought that was really good
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   so (2.5)
SB:   [inc] people
SH:   what local events, news history do you think it’s important people
      know (1.5) about in your town? (4.0) think we’ve really got that much
      (2.0) history really have we, I suppose, we have Manchester, but
I:    mm
SB:   yeah, I mean you’ve got the-
SH:   there’s nothing
SB:   you’ve got the-
SH:   particularly (0.5)
SB:   you’ve got the canals I suppose and everything haven’t we, but
SH:   the ship canal
SB:   the ship canal
SH:   Manchester ship canal
SB:   yeah, it’s mainly the hi- and Trafford Park’s got some history hasn’t
      it
SH:   Trafford Park, yeah, y- yeah, that’s right
TIME [36.00]
I:    mm
SH:   Trafford Park (2.0)
SB:   the de Trafford family, wasn’t it, and Trafford Park
SH:   yeah (0.5) and the links with Manchester really, I suppose
I:    someone said erm, the Beatles played at Chassen Park apparently
SH:   oh they did
I:    yeah
SH:   yeah, yeah, I- I think I’ve got a photograph,
I:    really?
SH:   or it mentions that in one of my local history books, you know the
      erm, (3.0) Urmston I don’t wheth- was it- was Chassen or it might’ve
      been (2.0) was it not Davyhulme park
I:    I’m not sure (0.5)
SH:   but it was somewhere
SB:   it was one of them, was it?
I:    mm
SH:   I think I’ve heard that before
SB:   oh, I didn’t know that
SH:   I’m sure
I:    [inc] it was interesting
SH:   yeah (0.5)
SB:   the Beatles played
SH:   so it must’ve been just before they became
SB:   mm
SH:   really famous
I:    mm
SH:   just when they were- when they were at the Cavern
I:    yeah
SH:   but they were just starting to be discovered, and for some reason
SB:   yeah, and they’re just going round the towns and
SH:   yeah,
SB:   doing little local gigs
SH:   they came here (1.0)
SB:   ooh, I didn’t know that
SH:   yeah (2.0) what are local people like?
TIME [37.00]
SH:   (1.5) well I th- I
SB:   I think they’re not too bad on the whole I think in Urmston and
      Stretford but I think
SH:   I think people are just quite down to earth really
I:    yeah
SB:   yeah
SH:   yeah
SB:   they’re down to earth but I think they- they tend to keep themselves
      to themselves, it’s not like
SH:   no (2.5)
SB:   in the old days where you’d know everybody, and like on our street,
      they don’t make an effort of coming over and (0.5) just sort of ga-
      having a chat
SH:   they just sort of go in the houses and (0.5) no
SB:   they might say, ‘oh, hiya’ and that’s about it [laugh]
SH:   that’s about it (0.5)
SB:   [inc] yeah (0.5)
SH:   yeah, I mean we fi- I must admit, we find that here but I didn’t know
      whether that was because it was a busy road and I think
I:    mm
SB:   yeah, it’s harder here isn’t it cos you’re on- on a corner and it’s-
SH:   when you’re on a roa- yeah, cos obviously your neighbours across the
      road feel sort of further away
I:    yeah
SB:   quite apart aren’t you, quite wide apart
SH:   and then we’re wide apart here, erm, (0.5) I think it was different
      at [anon] but whether that was because (1.5) the kiddies were younger
I:    yeah
SH:   so (0.5) when you’re walking to school, and obviously the school was
      only a few doors away from
SB:   yeah, mm
SH:   our house, so you did get to know lots of people
TIME [38.00]
I:    mm
SH:   erm, (2.5) so yeah, I think it was different then, did you find that
      when you were on [anon] or has yours never really been like that
      anyway,
SB:   no we were all quite friendly, and like you say, when- when the kids
      were littler and I was on the street more (1.0) tend to stop and have
      a chat, but now it’s just you get out of your car and you go in your
      house, just, do you know what I mean, I suppose it’s my fault anyway,
      not making an effort to go and speak to them as well, but
SH:   are they all- is it ma- is it the same people a lot of them?
SB:   yeah, a lot of them are the same people
SH:   yeah, so perhaps they’ve all got to the a- you know, the stage where
      the kiddies are grown up or they’ve moved out and
SB:   oh, they’re all grandparents now
SH:   and they’re grandparents,
SB:   yeah, the- yeah, most of them
SH:   so they’re the same (0.5)
SB:   yeah
SH:   cause you haven’t had many houses up for sale on your road over the
      years have you, all the t-
SB:   not really, no
SH:   I mean you get an odd one
I:    mm
SB:   yeah, you get an odd one, it- the- the one at the end’s been three
      times now up for sale, and new people in it the very last one, on the
      other side
I:    wow
SH:   yeah
SB:   that’s had quite a few people in it, erm, oh and next door but
      three’s now gone, that one that’s been up for sale for (0.5) ages,
      that’s now sold and there’s new people in their now
SH:   [anon]?
SB:   [anon] house
SH:   yeah
SB:   yeah
TIME [39.00]
SH:   saw the si- sold sign up there
SB:   so [anon] moved out last weekend
SH:   mm (0.5)
SB:   and so there’s, new family in there now (0.5) so, I don’t know what
      they’re going to be like
SH:   yeah
SB:   they look like they’ve got a young girl called [anon], and they’ve
      got a dog
SH:   oh
SB:   he looks about our age I think
SH:   yeah
SB:   the guy, so
SH:   yeah, so over the years really when you think there’s quite a lot of
      houses on that road,
I:    yeah
SH:   there’s not been-
SB:   but there’s not many comings and goings really
SH:   no
SB:   at all
SH:   no
SB:   erm, (2.0) so, yeah, we all kinda do know each other but (2.0) I
      think- I think next door because they’re Irish and because they’re
      Irish and because they’re Irish, they seem to take- talk a lot (0.5) I
      think the Irish are very friendly people
I:    yeah, they are
SB:   they seem to do all the ch-
SH:   with each other though?
SB:   yeah, yeah
SH:   do they tend to sort of, just sort of stick together?
SB:   yeah, they just said- yeah- they chat- you see them outside chatting
SH:   yeah
SB:   together more I think
SH:   yeah
I:    mm
SB:   but I can’t understand a word they say
I:    no [laugh]
SB:   I just c- [laugh] well I m- I mean I’ve lived next to [anon] for like
      how many years, I mean for goodness sake, twent- twenty
SH:   oh God, it’s about twenty
TIME [40.00]
SB:   twenty odd years and still
SH:   yeah
SB:   if he talks to me I really have to listen really carefully [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   [laugh]
SB:   I just cannot understand his l- now, his wife [anon] plain as- plain
      as English [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SB:   I can understand her, she’s, you know,
SH:   yeah
SB:   she just talks to me and- and there’s no problem but- but- but
      [anon], no chance
SH:   it’s like, ‘hang on a minute, hang on, hang on’
I:    [laugh]
SB:   yeah, just
SH:   yeah
SB:   no, I really have to listen hard
SH:   yeah
SB:   and carefully to when he’s talking to me
SH:   yeah (0.5) no, I was tal-
SB:   and they’re nice enough
SH:   I- I don’t know why but I think I’d like to live somewhere that was
      more- a bit more community though, would you, or?
SB:   yeah, there’s not a l- a very good community sort of spirit, we’re
      all- th- the neighbours are friendly enough, but no- nobody ever
SH:   yeah, they’re all- everyone’s nice,
I:    mm
SH:   everyone’s nice round here,
I:    yeah
SH:   it’s not a problem
SB:   nobody ever does anything
SH:   nobody’s horrible,
SB:   yeah
SH:   but there’s not (0.5) you know, that same community thing, sometimes
      I think (1.0) w- w- would it be different if you lived in a little
      village but then, would you perhaps be in each others pockets too
      much, would it- not pockets, you know what I mean,
SB:   yeah, yeah, everyb-
SH:   it- w- would it become a bit too intense,
SB:   yeah
I:    yeah
SB:   yeah, and people-
SH:   in that everybody would know everybody’s business
TIME [41.00]
I:    mm
SB:   that’s right, yeah, it gets a bit too much doesn’t it? (0.5)
SH:   cause I’m readi- at the moment I’m reading, erm, do you know- do you
      remember the film, ‘the Calendar Girls’
SB:   oh yeah
SH:   well, there’s erm, an- a bi- a sort of biography that was written by
      one of the women
I:    ooh
SH:   who actually (0.5) she was the best friend of the lady who lost her
      husband
I:    oh
SH:   and they were- they were raising the money for the hospital in his
      memory, and she’s the one who’d written the book (1.0), erm, and
      obviously they live in the dales- in the Yorkshire dales, in a small
      village, and reading it, you know, you sort of think, ‘ooh, it sounds
      brilliant, the- they’re all doing this together and they’re all doing
      that together’
I:    mm
SB:   [laugh]
SH:   and you sort of think, ‘ooh, I’d like to live in a village’ [laugh]
SB:   [laugh]
I:    [laugh]
SH:   but really would you like to live in a village
I:    yeah
SH:   erm, I’d like it from the community point of view, and I mentioned it
      to [anon] the other day, in fact we were talking to [anon] about it
I:    oh, okay
SH:   and [anon] goes, ‘oh I just like it the way it is, it suits me fi-’
I:    [laugh]
SH:   ‘it suits me fine’
SB:   yeah, yeah
SH:   but I think there’s something missing, really, I’d like a bit more
SB:   yeah, just a little bit more,
TIME [42.00]
SB:   just to get involved with something maybe in the li- on the village
      green or
I:    yeah
SH:   yeah, a bit of something, yeah
SB:   yeah [laugh]
SH:   cause I suppose we used to do all that when the kids were younger
      didn’t we with like, the scouts and the cubs, we’d be
SB:   yeah, yeah, I don’t-
SH:   fundraising and selling plants, and
SB:   yeah, I don’t get meself involved with anything really (0.5)
I:    [laugh]
SH:   no, I don’t
SB:   I suppose I should do really, that’s me being extremely lazy
SH:   yeah
SB:   because you could still do that, you could still-
SH:   you could w- I think we make the excuse, or I- I know I make the
      excuses cos I work full time
SB:   mm
SH:   but you could, you could come home and just get changed and go out
      and do something
SB:   and go out and do something, yeah
SH:   but
SB:   but then it’s voluntary, and you think I’m committed, and I have to
      keep doing it
I:    mm
SB:   whereas when it was the kids, you just said, ‘oh, I’ll help out’ and
      y- it was- it was
SH:   yeah, I think-
SB:   it was your perogative whether you said yes or no
SH:   yeah, so you could do it
SB:   you could do it
SH:   but you weren’t sort of thinking, ‘I’ve gotta do it all the time’
SB:   that’s right, yeah
SH:   yeah
SB:   it wasn’t a twenty-four seven day in, sort of, week in, week out
      thing
SH:   yeah (0.5) cos [anon] with his, erm, thing with Age Concern, he erm,
      (0.5)
TIME [43.00]
SH:   he has to really rush somedays, which, you know, it’s fine when he’s
      not rushing but,
I:    yeah

      even used a keyboard
