 Yeah. Can you just count to three please. One, two, three. Yeah. Ok
that’s great. When you’re ready. Ok Arnold **anon**. I’ll kick off-
we’ll kick off with you shall we? Your best or funniest memory. Best
or funniest memory from when I was young. When you were young. Can you
remember that far back? w- h- how young are we talking about here?
Again it depends really on how far back you can remember . Yeah, I
think the best- probably the best memory I have of- of being young is-
is Christmas time when all the family used to get together in those
days we- we always had all our aunts and uncles and cousins round on
Christmas day and- and erm- we- w- there wasn’t an awful lot of money
but erm we used to have quite a big s- slap up meal at lunchtimes and
lots of games and lots of fun. No television of course in those days
so yeah that’s probably the best memory I’ve got from being young. How
young were you then? When you did- when you did change? I would think
that was from being- from as early as I can remember being through-
going through to being about twelve. Something like EOS So your life
changed soon after you’ve met me? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But erm a- as- as
people grew older they didn’t want to- families got bigger as well.
They did- th- they didn’t get together the same. Up to that age I erm-
I think my Christmases were very similar in that people came to us for
a Christmas lunch. But because the erm, accomodation that we had at
the time was a bit cramped all the children went into the back room
and the adults were in the main dining room cos that’s when we lived
at the laundry. We had a chinese laundry in those days. And the- the
front room was shop. It was where we did the ironing, stored the
laundry that had been EOS And the middle room was the living room
where we did everything EOS And the back room was the stove room.
There was a coal fired stove with flat irons against it. But there was
a big table in there as well. So that’s where the kids sat to have
their Christmas dinner. But it was still good fun and happy times. How
many of you? In total people- oh- well there was- three six erm I- I
can’t think of it. Two sisters at the time **anon** and **anon**,
myself. **anon** wasn’t with us then. **anon** was an after thought. I
think my mum thought she was going to get a new washing machine for
Christmas you know. She got **anon** instead. Erm then there’d be my
three cousins **anon**, **anon**. You’ve met **anon** haven’t you? and
there’d be my grandad. Auntie **anon**, mum, dad, uncle **anon** and
auntie **anon** they were **anon** parents. Uncle **anon** and auntie
**anon** they were Pamela’s **anon** parents. Auntie **anon** used to
come on her own because grandad didn’t like uncle **anon**- and uncle
**anon** didn’t like Grandad . So he- had the- he had Christmas dinner
with his mother. So there was a lot of us. And erm the odd friend.
People like that used to pop in throughout the day. Erm- but one of
the most memorable things as a kid happened when I was at the laundry.
Erm when me grandmother was alive she used to make beetroot wine. And
you had to wait for it to mature- before you drank it. But I was being
a little bit eager and I opened one before it was ready and it was
like champagne and this red fizz went a- all over- Ah- oh no. freshly
laudered sheets, shirts, pillow cases. A whole days washing was
absolutely ruined. And I think I went to me bedroom, locked it, and I
was there for two day . I was scared stiff of me grandad. He really
did rule the roost. Yeah. Fearsome character but erm extremely kind as
well - and hard working. His day used to start at about six o clock in
the morning and go on till three o’clock the following morning. That
was Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Thursday, Friday, Saturday his day
started at nine and finished about five. But the laundry was all done
by then and it was just a question of taking in new stuff and
delivering your- or doleing out the laundered stuff to the erm- the
regular customers cos they nearly all were regulars in those days.
They all had their own laundry mark which was written on the back of
their laundry in small chinese writing EOS We didn’t know the names we
just knew the mark EOS Yeah but that was all before I knew you wasn’t
it Arnold **anon** the EOS That’s right yeah. You hardly ever went did
you to the laundry? No I never went to the laundry no. We- we had erm-
when I was nine year old we- we moved into a shop. We used to have a
shop in **anon**. My mother’s ran the shop. It was erm- ladies and
children’s wear shop. We had a few different sidelines as well. And my
mother used to work six days a week in that. Me dad was an engineer so
he went out to work where he used to help on a Saturday. And erm when
we were there for six years altogether and erm one of the things I
think I’ve mentioned this to Barney **anon** before that always sticks
in my mind that was on- on a Saturday because my mother was still
working in the shop- I used to go to the local chip shop for lunch and
I used to get three lots of fish and chips for half a crown in total.
Now half a crown was twelve and a half pence. So that just shows how
prices have changed. But erm one of the best things about living there
was the fact that we had a double cellar and in the cellar we used to
have a- a shooting EOS With an air rifle. Erm and my dad would set up
so you could- you could- you could put targets- three targets in at
one end- and th- and then shoot down this little- walled area and erm-
we also used to do photography as well in the cellar. We used to d- do
our own developing and printing and erm cos we had running water in
this cellar. We had a sink in the corner so- so erm yeah good times
yeah. But it- Yeah we used to do some of that didn’t we at- We did
that in erm- in my bedroom. in- in the attic didn’t we. Yeah in the
attic but there was no running water there. I don’t know how we coped
really. We did everything in my bedroom. There was a snooker table.
Yeah and we did the photography on top of the snooker table. And when
we weren’t doing the photography we were playing snooker. And somehow
we managed to fit my bed at the other end. Yeah. It was a big s- a big
attic. That was a big attic bedroom. And it wasn’t a small snooker
table it was a three quarter size snooker table. It was too big for a
normal house and I gave it to erm a youth club- in **anon** and erm
unfortunately it closed down soon afterwards didn’t EOS Oh no . And I
don’t know what happened to that table. Erm todays prices it was
probably worth about five, six hundred EOS But nobody wanted it cos
nobody had room for it. Sign of the times. **anon** taken my glasses
away. I know it’s big print. Are they yours? Mm? It’s alright. I can
read just fine. shall we move on to another- Would you like some
water? I’ll just get some. Do you want me to- I can get you some if
you like. We’ll carry on talking. Where are the glasses? Ah. Ask
**anon** she’ll know. Were there a lot of kids to play with when you
were growing up? There was when I- when I lived in **anon** before we
moved to the shop. Erm there were quite a few kids in the street and
they- erm all similar aged. Erm and because it was a cul-de-sac it had
a sort of a- a- it opened out and there was a- a- a good play area for
kids but we had all the fields at the back as well. And erm yeah there
were quite of- quite a number of erm both bl- boys and girls to play
with. Erm I was saying the age difference probably was three or four
years older than me to three or four years younger than me. So lots of
kids. Yeah I was the same. We had lots of kids when I was at junior
school because in those days most kids went to school near where they
lived. Nobody went to school by car. I don’t know how we managed.
Thank you. You get a waitress service as well. You got some- can I
have one of those mats? Can I just say when we went to junior school
all the kids lived near EOS Nobody ever went to school in a car. Not
even the teachers. They didn’t have cars did they. Oh I think maybe
the headmaster did. Maybe I think b- by the time we went to grammar
school they probably EOS Yeah. Headmaster had one. but I don’t
remember any of the- any of the teachers at junior school EOS cars at
all. But at grammar school they used to park just behind- well- well I
went to **anon** school. There’s- I did three years at **anon** school
erm before I moved to **anon** where Barney **anon** was. Erm
travelling from the shop in **anon** was about four miles to **anon**
school from there and there were probably three or four teachers had
cars in those days. And one of the- one of the erm- the thing that
everybody envied was my cousin. He was in the sixth form when I
started. And he had a motorbike and he used to park this motorbike in
the- in the little- there was a little extension to the playground
where the EOS parked their cars. And he used to erm leave his bike
there and I was the envy of the other kids when I got a lift home with
him. Yeah. We had a g- Cause there were no crash helmets in those- you
just got on the back and went didn’t you. Yeah there were always a
couple of guys at **anon** school had motorbikes and they were always
the ones that had girlfriends and erm- They’d imaged themselves on
James Dean and erm- who you might’ve heard of. And they were always
the rebels who left school with no O-levels and EOS but lots of
girlfriends. Lots of reputation behind them- which they c- couldn’t
put on theirs CVs . But at junior school lots of kids to play with.
Erm- Out- out playing everyday. Erm I don’t think our parents had any
fears about us going out and s- being out. When we lived at the shop
in **anon** there was just down the lane was a park with swings and-
and roundabouts and- sliding and erm we used to spend all day there
sometimes you know you- you didn’t w- h- worry about your kids being
out. Never heard of paedophiles and erm- Well it was a word that
hadn’t been invented I don’t think. Erm I don’t think it had no and-
Erm we had one in Eccles who I now realise was a paedophile. Everyone
knew him so you just avoided him. He was called **anon**. and he wore
a big fedora- Keep it anonymous. Yeah I’ll not tell you his surname.
And he wore a big long mac and great big boots. He was straight off a
Lowry. Erm and he had a most horrible face and sometimes you could
walk down towards **anon**- and you’d see him on the aquaduct. You
could- his image was there. So y- you now had to decide did you wait
for your mate before you went over the bridge to go to church- or did
you just wait ‘til he was looking the other way and run like EOS Well
that’s how we coped with paedophilia in those days. Just EOS I never
got that close to him. I don’t re- I don’t remember what he looked
like . Oh I- I go- I think he was just a legend when I went to- when I
got to **anon**. I got too close to his brother one day erm- there was
a guy who was in our year at grammar school **anon**. Do you remember
**anon**? Oh he lived near **anon** and he had a mad brother. And if
people used to hang about outside their house he’d open the window and
he used to have a jerry under the bed. A wee pot or whatever . And he
used to empty it. So- over whoever was standing outside his house. Aye
that was **anon**. But we were lucky where we lived **anon** because
there were lots of EOS Erm **anon** didn’t exist and you were soon
going toward **anon** EOS and round there there were lots and lots of
fields where you could just enjoy yourself and- go home with jam jars
full of newts and tadpoles and erm- Tha- that’s right and there was-
and there was no traffic on the roads. There was- there were very few
cars so you- you- there was danger of crossing main roads and- mm- No
you could go on your bike anywhere. I mean regular bike trips were-
places like Lymm, Pickmere. And if you were really fit Chester or
Southport. Mind you I did Chester once and I was so tired when I got
there. Had my- had my sandwiches bottle of pop., and I said ‘we’d
better get EOS ‘If I stay much longer I’ll fall asleep and I’ll never
get home’. Ah- it seems to take forever in a car now. It takes- it
seems to take longer in a car than it used to on the EOS It’s- so does
Southport. I’m sure. Used to- we always used to reckon Southport was
thirty EOS I’m sure it’s- it- it’s the road system. Must be the road
system these days it’s- it’s nearer forty- I noticed one of the
questions here says did you ever get hurlt- hurt whilst playing when
you were a kid? I remember breaking my arm once. We used to have- in
our garden we used to have a- a six foot wall at the back. Drop down.
And we used to swing on a s- on a washing line- out and drop into the
garden. And my f- ankle got tangled up in the rope. So I swung out and
my ankle stayed where it was- and I went down and I broke my arm.
That’s erm- I’ve only had three breaks in my life and that was the
first one. I’ve- I’ve never had a break. Mind you I’ve never played
rugby and you have. My only- I’ve only had one break playing rugby and
that was this erm metatarsal but erm I broke my ankle playing soccer-
when I was about eighteen, seventeen perhaps. Mm. Yeah the only visit
I had to erm casualty as we used to call it not accident and emergency
was when I fell off a swing. Must’ve been about nine, ten and there
was a little bit of competition going on to see who could do the most
daring things on the swing. Like jump off while it was still in the
air and not using your hands and just s- sticking with it and I got to
the back swing and just fell off chin first. Yes it was that scar.
Still got a scar? So I went home. Mum took me to **anon** casualty and
the nurse s- said ‘Oh well that’s one way to lose a bit of fat isn’t
it’ EOS then she just got her scissors out and cut the excess fat off
and stitched it up. Done and dusted. No local. Erm so that was
swinging. Erm- Yeah, the only other time in casualty, was erm three
years ago when I fell. Tripped over **anon**- Oh aye you did yeah.
**anon** the dog. I nearly lost me thumb and I had to have- they
couldn’t count the stitches. Well I couldn’t. I just got fed up of
trying to keep count. It was all round here as far as there. I was
lucky that **anon** was around and erm she wrapped a towel around it.
Put it in the air. And she drove me to hospital. And it was the first
time she’d driven EOS ‘I’ve never driven it before’. But you’ll soon
learn. How are we doing for time **anon**? Erm twenty one minutes.
Shall we mo- shall we move on? nearly- nearly half term. Yes lets move
on. It’s all about school and we’ve t- Oh we done- we’ve touched on
school. touch- touched on school and erm- what have we got there
scholarsh-? No where did you go to school it says. Where did you go to
school. Oh here right. Well I started at **anon** school. **anon** for
short. Erm **anon** was a victorian philanthropist who did things like
building hospitals and schools. And he built one in **anon** for the
erm Church of England children who lived in **anon**. There was
already a Church of England school there attached to the church-
called **anon**- **anon** but it was the other side of **anon**. And
very few lived on that side . Most of the kids lived on the **anon**
side. And that’s probably one reason why he sited it where he did in
erm- in **anon**. And I should think the bridge was probably closed a
lot more in those days as well than it is- it is today- Oh it’s very
busy traffic yeah. cause there was a lot of traffic up and down- the
ship canal- I bet it was opened and closed every hour. to the docks.
There was a- always queues. I remember queues when I first started
driving every time I tried to cross **anon** bridge. Went there from
five ‘til- five years ‘til I was ten and then **anon** ‘til I was
seventeen. Seven years there. Mm. I started at **anon** school in erm
**anon** or **anon** on the border I think which was just a- a
standard state school. Quite big classes in those days about- I think
I remember there were forty eight kids in EOS Erm and there were- it
was quite a big school because there were four streams A, B, C, and D
in the secondary school and we erm- tended t- to have just one teacher
for all the lessons. Erm and I remember that starting in the second
year at junior school and the- the teacher came in- our form teacher
and started writing on the board in real writing. And none of us had
learnt real writing before that time- so he realised he had to stop
and teach us how to do real writing- before he could teach us anything
else. So that’s- that’s the- the time we learnt it. And then in the
fourth year we all took our eleven plus t- to g- see if we could go to
EOS And out of the school- out of the year there were twelve people
passed their eleven plus. And I was one of them and I went to **anon**
grammar school. And erm touching on one of these questions here. First
day at- at school at **anon** school. There was an initiation ceremony
and between two sets of steps and the school there was a like erm a-
a- the- the bank went down and then there was like a- a gully which
was about three foot wide and three foot deep. Erm and probably ten
yards wide at the very most and all the first year kids were thrown
into that- on the first day. So there were probably fifty or sixty
kids crammed into this thing. And if you ever- if you tried to get out
you got thrown back in- Was it that- And that was called a monkey run.
Was that an all boys school- No no no no- or was it mixed? that was-
it was mixed but it was segregated playgrounds of course. Yeah yeah we
had that. Yeah it was mixed yeah. Yeah. That erm- so that was- Yeah w-
w- we had it like that. the monkey run. Everybody in brand new school
uniforms- got thrown in the dirt you know. The first day. Well I
suppose ours was a cleansing our i- initiation ceremony. You had your
head put in the toilet and the toilet flushed. I think a lot of
headmasters in those days tried to run their schools along public
school lines. And erm they must have knew- known these intiation
ceremonies were EOS Oh yeah yeah. and it were just ‘part of school
life old chap’. You know . Erm cos I presume you had to wear a school
cap did you? We had to wear a school cap at all times on the way to
school- on the way home from school, lunchtimes if you went out.
Although you weren’t generally allowed out of school unless you were
going home for EOS Yeah then you had to have written permission for
that didn’t you. Yeah yeah. Well I- I once got erm into trouble for
going out of school at lunchtime. We used- we used- we used- Well I
did. It was when I went out with you to the local café EOS But this
was when I was at **anon**- Had a quick pepsi and a woodbine . We got-
we got caned. Two of us went out to buy a bottle of sauce to have with
our school dinner. And we were on second sitting and we got caught.
Called before the headmaster and we got caned for erm going out of
school at lunchtime. what kind of sauce was it? Or Daddies I’m not
sure. One or the other. Yeah yeah . Did you have to wear short
trousers? No we- we- we weren’t obliged to wear short trousers. I wore
long trousers in the first year. Oh. We were erm- But no we could wear
long trousers. third year before we could wear long trousers. When I
joined **anon** school in the forth year there were still some of the
lads- wearing short trousers- in the forth year and that would’ve been
what age fifteen, sixteen? Yeah well if the parents still thought
‘those shorts still fit’- I’m not buying you long trousers just bec-
Waste of money. Yeah waste of money. Yes it was erm- the girls wore
gym slips in the winter and dresses in EOS Which they don’t seem to do
now do they. That’s right they- that was erm- that was the same at
**anon**. The girls had a uniform dress for the summer- for the summer
term. And the other two terms they had to wear gym slips up to a
certain age and then it was skirts and blouses wasn’t it after a
certain age and ties- Oh yes after y- about forth year. Yeah. Yeah.
White blouses. Yeah I’ve- I’ve got one of those old school photographs
that’s about a yard long- or two yards long. And you can see all the
different uniform styles- according to their ages on that. Show that
to **anon** actually- It’s quite interesting- cause I- I think we
both- Did you have them taken in your school? Yeah the long ones.
Yeah. I think we’re both on that one aren’t we? I think we are yeah.
Is that the fifty nine one- fifty eight one? Fifty eight, fifty nine
something like that yeah. Fifty eight yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You’re on the
back row. I was showing **anon** the other night. Were you? . Yeah
came across it. Yeah. Yes so we both remember our first days at school
then. I- I- my initiation was easy because I knew some of the lads in
the second year and erm they did me a favour and erm made sure I
didn’t get too much of a ducking in the toilets . They wanted me to
play football in their team as well. I spent my life- school life
being favoured and because I had a certain amount of what most people
thought was a little bit of talent at EOS And erm it was misguided.
This lad, cricket I was selected for the school cricket team. And I
was still in shorts and it was ridiculous going out to play cricket in
shorts. So my mum had to take me to the co-op in Eccles to buy me some
white long trousers to play cricket. And I never got a bat or a bowl.
I must’ve been a pretty good fielder EOS Mm. We used to erm- well we
both played for the same under fifteens- Oh yeah yeah. football team.
**anon** was captain who we still see occassionally. And erm Barney
**anon** was vice captain and I’d just joined the school in the fourth
year. And played in one or two games classes and they picked me to
play on the under fifteens team. So we’ve got a photograph of that
somewhere. We have. Yeah. Was the team good? We played in- and then we
played e- for the school team didn’t we the EOS And the erm- the full
team. But we were both quite keen on erm athletics and- and sports as
well. I never played cricket very much but erm- I used to join in all
the erm different sports day activities. Yeah I was erm junior
athletics champion. Me and **anon**, **anon**- That were before erm-
Before you joined wasn’t it. oh yeah cos you were a year- no it’s
probably the year I joined. But you were in- you were a year younger
than me. So you were still in junior school weren’t you. Well I w- I
was- in the second year. Oh is- it was when you were in second year
was it. Yeah I think to get- junior you had to be under thirteen. Did
you yeah. Cause I came second to **anon** in the erm middle school.
Erm Rex Ludorum they used to call it. King of the games. I came- I
came second and **anon** came third. Much to his annoyance. He’d been
bragging the year before- that he was gonna win it. what was the
leading girl called? If the leading man was Rex or Victor- Victor
Ludorum wasn’t it- the erm the men or the- Was it Victor a- at
**anon**. It was Rex at **anon**. Was it? Erm it was Victor at
**anon**. Victor at **anon**. Victor Ludorum. I don’t know what the
girl got called. No I only did Latin for one year. Don’t know. Didn’t-
I didn’t know any girls called Victor. Victorlia- Victoria Ludarum-
Ludorum EOS Oh blimey. No no- I don’t know what’s the female- that
would- that would stay- what’s the female adjec- that would stay no
Ludorum. W- Ludorum would be the same. Th- that would- that wouldn’t-
that wouldn’t be sexed. You don’t change it like in French from petit
to petite. No it’s- that- that Ludorum means ‘of the games’ doesn’t
it? So it could’ve been erm- Yeah Victoria Ludorum . Vict- could’ve
been Victris or some- Victrix. Victrix or something like that I
suppose. **anon** from Mercedes Benz. Erm could I give him a ring back
if you get his number? Please EOS Oh ab- another half an hour at
least. They always say ‘are you happy with your car?’ and I think yeah
EOS Yes, music music. We did a lot music together didn’t we. School
choir- Well yeah we were in- at gammar school. the school choir and
then- No I wasn’t in the school orchestra. No. No I never went in the
sc- well what did you play in the school- I played guitar but it- it
was the cello part. Oh yeah it’s right. That was after I’d left I
think. It was when I was in the sixth form. The teacher just put a
few- notes down that normally a cellist would play. And I had to just
plonk them out . But we erm- we played at the school concert didn’t
we. Played at school- school con- Our school dance. school dance yeah.
As a group. At the hop. Yeah. Yeah we- Did we call them dances or did
we- we didn’t call them hops or EOS No no no no. It was the school
dance. Yeah- at erm- we were the first group ever- to play at a school
dance. That was in nineteen fifty eight. Christmas dance. Aye. And
what did you- I can even remember what songs we played . What you sang
. Go- w- w- what songs did you play? It was erm- I sang erm Tom Dooley
and erm what was the other one. Flip side of it. What was it called?
Run a- rock my soul. Rock my soul in the bosom of- And you sang-
Travelling Light. Mm. And we’re still practising. still can’t play.
But I think we did- did we just do that one EOS Did they ask us back?
Well I w- well I left. You left of course yeah. I left that Christmas.
Yeah w- yeah I started work. Yeah. Yeah w- we went on to bigger-
bigger and better venues after school. I- Eccles town hall was our
last appearance. **anon** was the first EOS Yeah. And then he went off
to university so we split up then. and him and the lead guitarist and
the drummer they prefered to buy cars and motorbikes and things
instead of amplification. But we didn’t- no- not- no- but we’d have-
we wouldn’t have been able- w- we had amplification of EOS As such-
yeah. Of a sort. We had microphones sellotaped- to the back of our
guitars. leading into reel to reel tape recorders. So it was really
not loud at all EOS Mm. Oh it w- it was a treat to have played at a
venue where they had a microphone wasn’t it- Oh aye they had their own
PA system. because quite a few of them didn’t. So there were no mic-
no amplification in some of them. The school had a- a microphone
didn’t they. And the erm- certainly Eccles town hall did. Yeah and
Urmston baths. Urmston baths is- do you remember when it was the erm
circular one? Is that when it was the Curzon? Opposite the Curzon. Mm.
I- my dad’s told me about it. Yeah, well they used to have dances
there. They used to put boards over the- the pool EOS and we played
there once at Urmston and Flixton junior football league’s
presentation evening. We sounded good with the echoes and- Oh yeah
yeah the echoes. the water and- the roof top. And it was a complete
dome at the top made out of glass and one year I think it was s- let
me see **anon** was about six or seven. It’d have been about nineteen
eighty. We had in- tremendous hale stones. Bigger than golf balls. And
they went right through the roof of Urmston baths. And of course all
the glass followed and all the tiles were damaged EOS the council said
it’s erm not economical to repair. So they knocked EOS Oh is that why?
Oh I didn’t know that. and it was a magnificent building. Th- I’ve
seen a picture of- mm. they had diving boards and erm nice café sauna.
Did you ever go? Erm- I think I probably just went the odd time. But I
used to **anon** when I was younger and we used to go from school. We
were taught to swim from school went to **anon**. Yeah we went to
**anon**- from junior school. But at grammar school there was no
swimming at all was there. that was- that was quite- and **anon**. I-
I went to **anon** a few times. I lot of my youth I spent in the
scouts and the sea scouts based at **anon** from being about thirteen
year old- up to it was probably about twenty six when I packed it in
altogether EOS What we used to do spend a load of time goin away
camping and- Yeah. But erm- Well my grandad wouldn’t allow me to go in
the scouts. He didn’t believe in it. And grandad’s word was gospel. He
said it’s like Hitler youth. He thought it was an army for kids. But
being **anon** he wanted to be very, very English and tow the line. So
Sundays we weren’t allowed to play out. We were not forced but highly
encouraged to go to church. So eventually I joined the church choir at
about the age of seven or eight. So that meant you soon got promotion
cos there weren’t many boys in the choir. I think there were four of
us. You soon got promotion to alter boy. And then after confirmation
you had to go to the early morning mass. You took it in turns at going
to eight o’clock or nine o’clock. Then you were singing at eleven
o’clock mattins. You had to go to Sunday school at two o’clock . And
then six thirty evensong. Busy day . So busy day. So you didn’t have-
really have time to play out on a EOS Well everybody went to Sunday
school in those days- but it was- it was only once for me. There was
no choir cos it was a little mission church down in **anon**. Ah. Well
the- the- the choir was the undoing of the church in many ways.
Because we got a little bit beyond our station. We started singing
very high brow stuff like- Handel’s Messiah and- we had to have erm
choral communion every first Sunday in the month. And the congregation
got a bit fed up with it. Cause it wasn’t the sort of stuff where you
could join in the chorus EOS No no no. And the c- congregation
dwindled until there were more people in the choir than in the
congregation. And the erm th- the vicar wasn’t very dynamic and his
wife was always a little bit tipsy. She used to come in and stagger
down the aisle half way- half way through the service. Her hair all
over the place . So they knocked it down. And erm the school still
remains **anon** EOS You know where I mean? On one side on the- Yeah
the little school house there. Erm that’s up for sale. Well the church
was the other side wasn’t it? The church has gone. Yeah the church was
the other side of the school. That’s been flattened. My sister got
married there. Erm I think she was the last one ever to get married
there. Erm- Yeah so I was an usher at that wedding and I was a very
poor student EOS And I couldn’t possibly have worn me best suit cos it
didn’t look very best at all. So I went to C and A and all I could
afford was one that was five pounds fifteen shillings. It looked
really smart and it lasted for the wedding. And then about a week
later I was out in the rain with it and it’s like just falling EOS It
was. It was glued. It wasn’t stitched. So it was an expensive suit
really considering I only wore it twice- before I had to throw it
away.
