EOS What’s her f- EOS Can you switch off if you don’t think it’s
right? We were both born and brought up in in Salford. Is that the-
EOS Yeah that’s fine. EOS Yep. EOS Erm you lived across- we- EOS I
lived across the f- there was a football pitch. I lived at one end and
you- EOS And I- I lived with my grandma and mum and dad. Erm and she
had what they called then a corner shop- EOS Oh. EOS which s- it sold
everything. Bread and milk and erm we lived with her because she’d
just lost her husband and bought this shop and erm my dad was a
painter and decorator and had a lot of out of work. EOS And he used to
get three- he- EOS He- he worked for himself. He had his own business.
EOS He didn’t then. EOS Oh no he didn’t **inc** EOS And he used to get
three pounds a week- EOS Wow. EOS to keep us all and he used to give
it my grandma. And in return he used to get a couple of packets of
cigarettes. EOS So erm you lived across. EOS I lived across yes-
across the pitch. EOS Erm and during the war, just after the war she
used to put cigarettes under the counter for you didn’t she? EOS
**inc** I- I didn’t smoke then but I erm- I worked as a erm motor
mechanic and the lads there, there was quite a lot of them smoked and
you couldn’t get cigarettes because they were under the counter. EOS
Oh. EOS ‘Would you go and ask your girlfriend’s grandma’ . EOS Erm
would she let us have some cigarettes. Which she used to like- EOS Mm,
mm EOS let us have a few packets now and again. EOS But erm I didn’t
have any brothers and sisters. EOS But there were lots and lots of
children. EOS Mm. EOS And erm we used to play outside on the erm
pavement. There were no gardens. It was just erm streets in . And erm
we used to chalk the flags and play hop-scotch and erm play ball
against the wall. And erm hide and seek in peoples’ doors and I have
been known to knock on doors and run away. EOS And I got a good smack
off my mother for doing that because she caught me. And erm we used to
erm- we never went far away from where we lived and everywhere was
very safe. There was no- EOS Mm. EOS no erm hint of any people- EOS
Danger. EOS doing wrong things to children. EOS Not like there is
today. EOS There was nothing like that. EOS Mm. EOS No. EOS Where I
lived anyway. Erm as I say my grandma had a shop. EOS Erm I can
remember bread being four pence and milk being four pence at the same
time. And erm she used to have this machine where she cut all the
bacon up by hand with a machine that you turned a handle. And she had
loads of sweets in one window and I was not allowed to touch them- EOS
unless I asked her could I have some. Now I was allowed but if I was
caught taking any I got another smack off me mother across my legs.
EOS She was a very strict- yeah. B: And it never ever did me any harm.
Erm and I did have to help out in the house because we used to stone
the steps. We used to stone the step of the shop and stone the window
ledges of the house- EOS Mm **inc**. EOS all the way round. And stone
the back steps- EOS The back yard yeah. EOS with a- a brown stone or a
cream stone. And while I was doing it I was told to do next door so I
had to do those as well. EOS And erm what about you? What did you do?
EOS What did I do? EOS When you were young. What did you play? EOS
Well I used to pla- play a lot of football. EOS Yeah. EOS I used to
love football and of course facing the house was this big football
pitch . EOS Which was horrible surface. EOS Which was- EOS Oh was it?
EOS int- in- incidentally- it wasn’t- EOS It was like cinders. EOS I
was a cinder pitch really. When you fell down it- it used to take part
of your knee cap off. EOS Ouch. EOS So constant- constantly you had
black marks on your knees EOS where the cinders had gone in. EOS Mm.
EOS And erm but I used to love playing football and erm I used to also
like repairing bicycles. EOS But what- also what did you used to do?
You used to go on the hills at which was near prison. EOS Oh no. EOS
And what did you used to do there? You used to go swimming in the- EOS
Swimming in these- EOS horrible dirty filthy water. EOS Yeah. EOS When
you think about it yes. EOS There was they were like erm they were
like big clay pits and they’d filled with water and we used to go
swimming in there. I’d- Many a time I’d cut my foot, my legs because
there was broken bottle- EOS Oh no. EOS There was old prams in there.
EOS Terrible when you think of it. EOS When I think about it now. EOS
I mean I wasn’t allowed. EOS Yeah. EOS I didn’t know this went on
until we started to go out as erm w- when I was about fifteen or
sixteen. Keith used to mend my bike and I used to go for chips for all
the erm- EOS All the- all the- EOS boys and girls that were all round
on the corner there. EOS But erm **inc** EOS But m- us best or
funniest memory was during the war and erm we used to go- w- we had a
back yard and it had a little garden ine itwith a beautiful tree in
it. The erm- EOS Oh erm th- what’s- the elderber- EOS elderflower
tree. EOS Elderflower. EOS So we did have a bit of a- a little bit of
garden but this brick- they came and built these brick shelters. I
can’t remember w- w- how- the shelter being built. EOS But my dad made
it very nice inside with beds and we had erm some kind of a light in
there and erm my grandma would never ever come down when the air raids
went. EOS Yeah. EOS And it was very frightening- EOS Mm. EOS and it
must’ve been very frightening for them but I was only nine, ten. EOS
Mm. EOS And it- to me it was a big adventure. EOS And one night my dad
was a- an ARP warden like you see on erm Dad’s Army. EOS And erm one
night they dropped all these incendiary bombs on this pitch at the
back of our house. EOS **inc** and they hit erm- EOS And erm- EOS the
prison. EOS my dad- EOS prison that night. EOS Oh. EOS My dad dragged
the dustbin out which in those days they were metal dustbins. EOS Mm.
EOS He dragged it outside and he said ‘come on Brenda and help me fill
it with water because w- we’re going to have to put all these fires
out’. And I was running backwards and forwards and passing him all
this water. And erm we put the light on. EOS And I said to him ‘daddy
this water’s not going- there’s no water in it’. And unfortunately in
the- so it- to me it’s very funny this. EOS We were dashing backwards
and forwards with this buckets of water and there was a big hole in
the dustbin. EOS So as fast as we were p- EOS , EOS Putting the water
in it was running out. EOS putting the water in EOS Oh no EOS Yeah EOS
So that to me is a- a long- it’s- I mean it’s a long time ago and I
remember that and it was very funny. EOS And erm when these bombs
these incendiary bombs dropped they dropped one outside a lamp post.
You used to have big lamp posts in those days. I don’t know what- what
were those lamp posts erm- EOS They used to be gas. EOS Gas. EOS Gas
lit. EOS Mm. EOS And erm m- EOS Well they were, they were ga- EOS I’ve
never seen my grandma come down the stairs as quick. EOS She’d never
ever got up. She used to stay in bed. But she was down those stairs.
EOS And one night me mother came out and she’d got the budgie on her
head. EOS Oh no . EOS So she had to t- and I said m- I used to call
her mammy ‘mammy’. The- I for- forget what the bird was called. EOS
‘So and so’s on your head’. Sh- She turned quickly back and went you
know went back in the house so that was another funny memory. EOS And
erm- about parents- EOS Erm what I used to do was erm when I think
about it now I would never let my sons do that. But erm I used to erm
when the air raids were on- EOS Mm. EOS I used to go out with a- a
bucket and a pair of coal tongs and I’d be picking shrapnel up. EOS Oh
EOS You’d- you’d- you’d be s- listening ye- and you’d hear it going
‘shhhhh’ down the road. And you could see it was white hot. When I
think that really that my parents let me go out- EOS Mm. EOS picking
the sh- the shrapnel- EOS Mm. EOS the pieces of shrapnel up. I had
buckets and buckets of it. EOS did you? EOS And we used to swap it
with one another you know. It- it- if it had got the German erm- erm-
EOS emblem on you used to erm swap it for something else. EOS Mm. EOS
Incendiary bombs had the German mark on. EOS Mmhmm. EOS And erm- EOS
But as I say we were children. It was an adventure to us. EOS Yeah.
EOS Erm I- I th- I thought it was great- EOS But can you imagine if it
happened now. I’d be absolutely- EOS Yeah. EOS Mm. EOS frightened to
death. EOS When you know what’s going on. EOS You would. It- it would
be a very frightening experience cos my mother was a very nervous
lady. EOS Yeah. EOS And she must’ve been absolutely frightened to
death. EOS Terrified yeah. But on this football pitch facing they dug
it all up and put the biggest air raid shelter you’ve ever seen on the
ground. EOS Really? EOS Yeah. And we used to go in there. It- it was
terrible. It was t- EOS Well I never went in. EOS Oh the- the smell.
EOS My mother wouldn’t go in there so- EOS But we- we had a- EOS Mm.
EOS one built in the back erm- the back yard. EOS Yeah they built
these brick- EOS Brick solid- EOS They were very strong brick. I meant
there were different types of shelters. EOS Mm. EOS My auntie who
lived in Urmston she had one and it was called a Morrison and it was
like a big cage. EOS A- anderson ones. They- EOS Mm. EOS Just like a
big cage. A Morrison. EOS Oh that was the Morrison yes. EOS And erm
she used to have a lovely- a lovely embroidered cloth on it- EOS and
flowers. And if the sirens went she used to go under there with her
husband. They had no children. Erm and then there were the Anderson
ones with people in the garden. You used to go down into those. EOS
Mm. EOS But erm m- there was w- called a blitz. Erm it was a christmas
blitz wasn’t it? EOS Yes that was the biggest . EOS Nineteen forty-
forty one. And my grandparents lived in which is in- still in Salford.
And when I think of it now they wouldn’t have allowed a child but I
was ten and my mother put me on the bus where we lived- EOS mm. EOS to
go and see- ‘go and see if your grandma’s alright.’ And I went on my
own you know th- EOS Mm. EOS it would be unheard of now wouldn’t it?
EOS Yeah. EOS And erm when I got there the street had been bombed- EOS
It’d gone. EOS and all the houses the curtains the windows were all
blown out. EOS Oh. EOS And I stood at the top of this street and I
cried. EOS Mm. EOS And this man came to me and he said ‘what’s the
matter?’ and I said ‘I’ve come to see my grandma and look at the
house’. He said ‘don’t worry I’ll take you’. They’ve taken them to th-
what they called a rest centre and it was in a church. EOS Church
yeah. EOS And he took me there. Now in this day and age I didn’t know
the man. EOS Mm. EOS Well you know y- EOS when you think. Erm there
was no- EOS I think- EOS there was none of that fear. EOS I think you
were safer then than you are today. EOS Oh yeah. EOS It’s- EOS I do
really think so. EOS Y- you never heard of people being murdered and
stabbed and- EOS No no. EOS and like I say you used- you used- you
used to t- travel quite a way on your own didn’t you? EOS Yes you did.
EOS **inc** young. Going to school. EOS Oh yes. I went to school. Was-
**inc** yeah- EOS Which is quite a way from- EOS I went to- I went to
School. Before that I went to School and my mother used to take me and
bring me home four times a day. EOS Really? EOS She used to take me in
the morning. Come home. Come for me at lunchtime. We used to go
through a- and a park called Park which is still there. Take me back.
Then come for me back again in the afternoon. EOS And then I went to
School EOS and I used to walk there e- but if me mother could afford
it I used to go on the bus. EOS Mm. EOS And it was a g- a long way
from where I lived. EOS It was a long way yes. EOS So erm that school
isn’t there anymore School. It was called Bella Vista because it was
the consul at one time. EOS Yeah. EOS And it was a beautiful house. It
was really lovely. So erm and what do you remember from your first day
at school? I cried and cried- EOS and the Headmistress was called and
she said to my mother ‘leave her, she’ll be alright’ and I sat at side
on a chair for three weeks. EOS And she said to me mother ‘she’ll get
fed up before I will’. EOS Mm. EOS So that was- I hated it and I was
very upset and eventually - I got very friendly with her and she
eventually erm persuaded me to go into the classroom . EOS No I never
got into trouble at school. I was quite a good child I think. EOS We-
talking about holidays we erm w- never had any holidays. Th- th- the
erm- EOS oh switch it off. EOS That alright? Is that ok? EOS Yeah
that’s fine. Don’t worry. EOS Hello Telephone conversation omitted EOS
No thank you EOS They’ve got ten eight hundred and thirty four pound
vouchers to give out. So I don’t- EOS Sounds a bit odd. EOS oh,
they’re always sending me- EOS No I- I never had- I never went on
holiday. The only holiday I’ve ever had was- EOS You had a lot of
brothers and sisters. EOS I- I did. EOS I was an only child. EOS Yes I
had erm four brothers and one sister. And erm- but we never had
holidays. Only days out to Blackpool. EOS Mm. EOS But my- one of my
brothers- I had four half b- brothers. Step brothers. And erm he- he
was a mechanic and erm he- he- he used to do quite well and he said
‘if you save your spends up’ which was about in today’s money about
five p a week- EOS erm ‘you can come away with me’ and he had a m- a
car which in the- those days was fantastic you know. EOS Mm. EOS If
somebody had a motorcar- EOS Well if you had a friend that was a car-
EOS Yeah. EOS that had a car it was absolutely marvellous. K: Well he
had a car and erm and erm he- he said ‘save your- save your spends up
and I’ll take you erm away for a week’. And he did and we w- went to
Wales and when I was sat at- I can see myself now sat in that car. And
I- I was hoping all my friends could see me - EOS yeah. EOS going away
on holiday. And that was about the best holiday I ever had then- EOS
Mm. EOS as- as child cos I never went away again after that. Like I
say we used to go, **inc** EOS now and again they’d take us to
Blackpool on the train. EOS Mm. EOS For a day. But erm that was it.
EOS Well I went to Blackpool once a year for a week. And what you did
it was a- I forget what they called it. It wasn’t self-catering but
you bought the food and the person that you were staying with erm she
cooked it for you. EOS Th- th- they- c- cooked it for you yeah. EOS Oh
ok. EOS I don’t know what they called it but th- they did a lot of
that in those days and that street it’s or . It’s still there in
Blackpool and we went once a week- erm once a year for a week. **inc**
can I go- move onto that one? EOS Yeah, whatever. EOS Yeah. Oh I did
get hurt while- when I was playing as a child. Like Keith said erm I
fell on this what we called a rec. We called it the rec didn’t we? EOS
Yeah th- it was a- yeah we called it a rec. EOS I- I- It was short for
recreation ground EOS mm EOS but we called it the rec and I fell on
there. EOS Ooh and I had terrible knees. EOS I had- EOS and erm- EOS I
always had- EOS They were awful- EOS and we’d gone to- my mother had
bound them up and we’d gone to visit me grandma who was a- she was a
lovely lady and they lived in . And she said ‘what’s she done?’ and my
mother told her and she looked at it and she said ‘get those bandages
off’ because they’d all pussed over. EOS Oh no. EOS She said erm ‘let
it- let- get the air to them’. I can always remember it and within a-
a day they’d- they’d all dried up. So - EOS I’ve always remembered
that ever since . Your home town. Shall we go onto home town? EOS Yeah
you can do yeah. EOS A- EOS Do you want me to talk or- EOS Yeah go on
I’ll- EOS are you going to say where were your parents from? EOS Oh
parents from. Well erm my parents erm my father worked at erm- EOS
from , from . EOS Oh my- my- m- m- my erm mother’s family originate
from . EOS Oh okay. EOS That’s where erm- that’s where they were erm
born. But my father worked at Erm, which was at Gorton. were
locomotive engineers and he used to cy- EOS They made the big steam
trains you know. EOS Steam trains and that. EOS Oh ok. EOS And he used
to erm cycle from erm all the way to Gorton every- EOS Wow. EOS and
back again which is a heck of a way . Like I say in- in regards to
toys I’ve had very, very little toys. But my father had some cowboys
and indians made. He- he g- he got the erm the chaps at work th- that
make the erm moulds in- they made these erm moulds for soldiers and
cowboys and he- he made- he made them out of solid lead. When you
think now, EOS I used t- they weren’t painted when- and I got them for
Christmas and when I think I used to play with lead soldiers . EOS
Yeah . EOS You know which is really harmful for you. But that was the
only erm toys I had and I had them for years I was playing with those.
EOS My interests when I was a child, I’ve just seen that there, erm
was music. I learned to play the piano. EOS Oh. EOS And erm I- I loved
music in any- any form really. EOS Mm. EOS And I still do. I still
sing and erm we have a music group at church but of course that’s- i-
that’s lo- current at the moment but me parents, my father was born in
and my mother was born in erm- down erm in Salford in . EOS Mm. EOS So
erm I don’t know why me- me father came to live in Salford but erm my
mother’s never been anywhere- no she was born here. EOS And erm I’ve
got a picture of her when she was a little girl. So she’d- she was
born in nineteen hundred and two so it’s quite and old picture . EOS
yeah. EOS And if you ever want any old pictures I’ve got them. EOS
Erm- erm we didn’t move house at all. Erm we went to live in that shop
as I say with my grandma and the next move we made was when she died
and they sold the house, my mother and father, and we went to live in
. We were still in Salford and erm Keith was in the army weren’t y-
nati- doing his national sh- service. EOS Yeah. EOS And erm we married
from the house in didn’t we. EOS Well I was in the army. EOS Yes he
was in the army. EOS Because erm- erm then i- it was a s- sergeant
said to me- he said- I told him that I was en- engaged- EOS Mm. EOS to
be married when I came out of the army. He said ‘well really you’d be
better marrying because you’ll get marriage allowance’. EOS Oh. EOS So
w- we arranged didn’t we- EOS Yes- EOS I’d been in the army about- EOS
and I was twenty one. EOS Yeah. EOS And y- Keith was twenty two when
we got married. Mm. EOS So we did erm get married- EOS Yeah. EOS and
erm and of course Brenda got the erm- the erm marriage allowance and
saved it up and we had a nice little nest egg didn’t we- EOS Mm. EOS
when- when I came out. EOS And that’s when I came up to from with a
friend who was looking at some houses erm on the front there, near .
EOS Mm. EOS They were building those semis r- just round the corner
when you go towards the Trafford Centre. EOS Yeah. EOS There’s some
semis there- EOS Yeah. EOS and erm and she went to look at those and
then we came to look at these on and I liked these. EOS No we- we
brought them up didn’t we and y- your father’s- EOS No, no that was
after. EOS Oh. EOS That was after. No I brought erm I can’t remember
her name now. No you weren’t very friendly with her but then- EOS Mm.
EOS I saw these and went back home and told Keith and that’s- that’s
when we came to live in . EOS In- in th- EOS In this house in . Yeah.
EOS Fifty five years ago. EOS Yeah. EOS Wow. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. EOS Mm.
EOS And we- we paid one thousand eight hundred and fifty pounds. EOS
No one thousand six hundred and fifty pounds. EOS Oh one thousand six
hundred and fifty pounds for it. EOS Sixteen hundred and fifty. EOS
Amazing. EOS Eh. It’s amazing isn’t it? EOS Yeah. It is. EOS But we
brought a friend with us who was my son- my eldest son’s godfather and
they lived in . And he was a very astute man and a very good man and
a- we really were very fond of him. And he came with us to look at
them and my dad was very much against us buying it. He said ‘you’ve
got a milstone round your neck’. That’s what he said. EOS But we were
very happy living with your parents. EOS Oh yes- EOS They had that big
house in and- EOS we were very, very happy. And erm my mother- and he-
my mother thought the world of Keith and he thought the world of her.
Erm but erm this friend of ours came to talk me dad round to say that
he had bought his house and it was three hundred and forty pounds. EOS
And that was- EOS And that was a milstone round their neck but it
wasn’t anymore. EOS No. EOS And he said eventually it will be
beneficial to them. So that’s- he talked my dad round and- EOS Well
the thing was you could rent a house then. EOS Mm. EOS You could rent
houses. EOS Mm. EOS There was- there was plenty to rent. EOS Mm. EOS I
mean not like n- not like today. EOS But we just liked these houses.
We thought they were absolutely lovely and erm m- m- what it- what was
it we hadn’t got money for? Erm- EOS Oh the erm- EOS and my dad lent
us the twenty five pounds. EOS we didn’t have the money for the erm
the rest of the money for the deposit. EOS Mm. EOS It was a hundred
pound deposit. EOS Mm. EOS We’d paid forty but there was sixty
outstanding and w- we k- kept coming round and having a look and it’s-
once they got the roof on they wanted the balance. EOS Mm. EOS Oh. EOS
And I thought- the came and they’d got the roof on. EOS And by the
Keith wasn’t a mechanic. He was working for me father who was a
painter and decorator and you had to have e- eleven pounds a week
wages. They wouldn’t take the wife then. EOS Oh. EOS It was just the
husband it- EOS you know if you were working that didn’t matter. EOS
And I was earning ten pounds. EOS And he was earning ten and me- my
dad said to Keith ‘well tell them you’re earning eleven but I can’t
afford to give you that’. EOS so EOS And he- he lent us the money for
the erm- EOS Yeah. EOS the balance. EOS But when you think of those
figures. EOS Yeah. EOS I know. EOS But you see it just- it goes on and
on. EOS Yeah it does. EOS I meant when- when you get older you’ll
think well fancy those prices that we paid then. EOS Yeah. EOS So erm
yeah. Erm in your opinion how has the community changed in recent
years? Well I think it changed tr- tremendously. Tremendously. There’s
a lot of terrible things happen now that I don’t think did happen
then. Children are- are not safe anymore like they used to be. And
erm- EOS You can’t afford to take your eyes off them can you. EOS and
everything is so expensive to take them anywhere. EOS Mm. EOS I mean
my son has just been away with four and he said when you go in a- just
for a coffee. EOS It’s six coff- well five coffees or five drinks. EOS
Mm. EOS And it’s so expensive isn’t it. EOS Yeah. EOS But erm
everything has- has really gone up in price. EOS The most important
changes have taken place in your town. EOS Mm well- EOS Well when we
came round here from erm- from we thought we were coming to live in
the country- EOS In the country. EOS Right. EOS It was beautiful. EOS
It was so quiet- EOS Mm. EOS and erm- EOS Mm. EOS You could park
anywhere in Urmston and erm- but now I think it’s- EOS And we liked
Urmston as it was. EOS It- well w- we did yeah. EOS But I mean now I
think they’ve just made a mess of it. EOS Mm. EOS because it’s part
finished and- EOS Yeah. EOS and they’re not saying- they’re saying
until they- I think they- somebody said that they’ve run out of money
the developers. EOS Yeah I think they have. EOS And erm- so it’s just
a mess I think. EOS I think they expected more people to erm buy those
apartments- EOS I think- EOS in the centre, but then- EOS Yeah and
they haven’t done. No. EOS No. EOS No. No they haven’t. And I think
they’re the ugliest looking things. EOS Yep EOS We only said the other
day look at all that horrible wood. EOS **inc** timber. EOS Mm. EOS
Where’s the design in that? EOS I know. EOS **inc** it’s not- EOS And
then of course a build-up of erm- I’m not objecting to the Trafford
Centre but the Chill Factor and erm all these big things that keep
going up. It’s just lost it’s erm I don’t know, prettiness really. It
used to be a pretty village more or less Davyhulme. And I know things
have got to progress but I don’t- I hate all these great big things
that are going up. EOS Yeah. EOS And erm I don’t know. Local people-
EOS but we remember the first erm- EOS We remember the- EOS shopping
centre being built in Urmston. EOS Yeah. EOS The precinct there. EOS
Yeah. EOS And it was nice. EOS It was nice before. EOS It was a nice
precinct that. EOS It- no it was nice before that they did that I
thought. EOS Mm mm. EOS It was quite quaint. I’ve s- I’ve got loads of
pictures of that. EOS Mm. EOS How it used to be . But erm- EOS But I
do think there’s a lot of community things happening now like erm the
man that owns that . EOS Yeah. EOS Now f- I think it’s the third year
now that he’s put this community erm- EOS The summer- EOS sort of a
carnival type thing hasn’t he. EOS Yeah. EOS In the grammar school
gardens and I think- we went because my granddaughters were dancing.
EOS Ah. EOS They go to . EOS Mm. EOS And they were doing this dancing
group and we went to watch them and I just thought it was lovely. EOS
Yeah. EOS Yes. EOS All the people- local people all mingling with one
another. EOS Mmhmm EOS And I really- I r- it really uplifted me to see
them all having a good time and there was no trouble. EOS Yeah. EOS
Erm and I think the community spirit here is better and hope it will
get better. EOS Mm. EOS Erm the carnival on Saturday- there’s the
carnival on Saturday and for the first time there’s erm an ecumenical
church tent being erected. EOS Right. EOS And they’re giving free teas
and cakes. In fact we’re involved with it. EOS Mm. EOS And it’s the
first time they’ve done that and erm hope- hopefully well they will be
telling people all about the things that go on in all the churches.
Hopefully we might get a few more people to come. EOS Yeah. EOS But
it’s still a community thing and I think- EOS Gets people together
yeah. EOS it’s a good thing for the community EOS Mmhmm EOS Yeah I li-
I- EOS Yeah and erm there’s not really- when you look at the
television and see all the horrible things that happen in other towns.
I don’t know I’ve never heard of anything horrible - EOS No I haven’t
EOS happening in Urmston at night. EOS No. EOS So I just hope that
erm- there’s- I think there’s quite a long of thing to ha- to do in
this community if you’re willing to erm- EOS you know different erm-
erm what- what can I call them, different groups. So you needn’t be
bored. There’s lots to do really. EOS Yeah. EOS If you go out and look
for it. What’s your- do you agree with me? You see- EOS Yes I d- EOS
we’re very involved in church so I’ve always got something to do. EOS
Mm. EOS I mean I’m going out tonight. No I’m going out tomorrow and
erm going out next week all the meetings start so I’ll be out about
three nights a week which is erm- is very good. EOS Mm. EOS Mm. Right
. EOS **inc** erm- erm. EOS I think it’s very sad that erm TJ Hughes
has gone from Stretford. EOS Yeah. EOS I think it’ll be a- make a big
difference to Stretford erm- erm town centre. Erm cos I like- I like
that erm shopping precinct. It’s pleasant and it’s warm and- EOS Mm.
EOS erm it’s somewhere for people to meet. I don’t know what’s going
to happen there. EOS Did you ever get into trouble at school? Going
back a bit now aren’t I really. EOS Does it matter? EOS No of course
it doesn’t. EOS No it doesn’t matter? Yep . EOS Did you get into
trouble? I didn’t- EOS Yeah- oh no you didn’t, no. EOS I was perfect
EOS Hey we- we used to c- I went to School first and from there I went
to school, . And on the way home from when we were at erm- EOS erm the
erm- we used to pass this house that had a cherry tree hanging over
the wall. And ev- everyday you passed it seemed to get redder and
redder these cherries and me and my friends one day we thought I think
we’ll have some of those . EOS And we climbed on the wall and just
pulled a little bunch down and we both had one each. And they were
horrible. EOS oh no. EOS But we didn’t- unknown to us there was
policeman behind us who grabbed us EOS and took us back to school. And
erm the next morning we had to come out in front of the- all the
assembly and the pair of us were brought out to the front and- and the
teacher erm- the teacher said- the Headteacher said I’d have- we’d
have to go to his room after and of course we were- our heads down and
we both got the cane on both hands. And when we used to walk past that
house with those cherry trees EOS we used to have our hands in our
pockets . EOS Mm. EOS Yeah well I think there again- I think it’s gone
from the sublime to the ridiculous. EOS Yes you’re not allowed to
touch- EOS Because I think it’s digusting now that children have got
no respect- EOS Mm. EOS for policemen and really a lot of them have
not got any respect for anybody. EOS Anybody. No. EOS And they try and
blame everybody bar the parents. EOS I know. The riots were terrible
weren’t they. EOS Oh that- EOS Oh that was terrible. Well what’s
uplifted me was the m- the all those young people going in and
cleaning up. EOS Yeah. EOS Yes. EOS I thought that was wonderful EOS
Yeah. That was brilliant. EOS And some of them looked- I thought golly
you’d- EOS yeah. EOS You know so you can’t tell by how people look.
EOS No you’re right. EOS No. EOS But I do think it’s erm you know that
being allowed to throw stones at policemen. I was frightened to death
of policemen. EOS Oh yes. Y- EOS I- that was silly but I’d rather it
be like that- EOS Mm. EOS than like it is now. I mean policemen are
there to erm to keep- EOS To protect the- EOS to protect people- EOS
protect the public. Yeah th- EOS and the public. EOS And they get a
terrible lot of bad pub- publicity. EOS Yeah. EOS And I know maybe
there are some sadistic policemen but most of them are very good and
decent men. EOS Yeah. EOS And erm I just think it’s awful that
children should be taught to have more respect. EOS Mm. EOS Erm and I
still blame the parents for a lot of these children. EOS Yeah. EOS Yes
it’s sad really. I- EOS And I think a lot of these children as well
are from broken homes and they’re living in erm social erm- erm
they’re- they’re under the care of the erm- Trafford. EOS Yeah. EOS
And erm I’ve heard reports that they just run wild and you’re not
allowed to touch them. You’re not- if- they know that if you touch
them they can report you. EOS Mm. EOS And I mean I used to get lots of
smacks off my mother and it never did me any harm at all. And erm I
can always remember when I was- my mother had just given me a good
hiding and she’d gone into the kitchen and I walked behind her and
pulled my tongue out. EOS And she turned round and I got another one.
EOS oh no. EOS And I said ‘what was that for?’ ‘because’ she said
‘you’ve just pulled your tongue out haven’t you?’. And years after I
said ‘how did you know?’. She said ‘I just knew you were going to do
that’. EOS But we end- we were always the best of friends. EOS Mm EOS
Really good pals. EOS Erm I can stop that- this now if- three EOS one, two, three EOS yep, go EOS one, two, three EOS
perfect, when you’re ready EOS erm, I already know the answer to this
question, but how many brothers and sisters have you got EOS erm, two
sisters, one brother EOS two sisters? EOS yeah, well, Mum got with a
new step-dad didn’t she, and after about a month or so she was
pregnant so EOS ooh EOS but , she’s four EOS four now, bloody hell,
that’s been a long time EOS think she’s four EOS since erm, when we
was in Scouts wasn’t it? EOS yeah it was, when was that? About eight
years ago? EOS God, I can’t even remember, was it longer than that?
was back in two thousand four? EOS Jeez EOS at the latest EOS was you
in Salford Scouts or was it just explorers? Was in Salford Scouts as
well? EOS yeah, yeah, well hundredth Salford wasn’t it EOS hundredth,
ah, you were the enemy EOS yeah EOS fifty nine EOS was you? so what’ve
you got, you’ve got EOS , , and **inc** EOS how old’s- how old’s now?
EOS he’s four years younger than me, so he’s EOS he’s not? EOS
seventeen EOS Jesus EOS or something EOS I remember him when he was
about, like EOS oh no, is it nineteen, might- it’s nineteen, sorry EOS
it’s nineteen EOS yeah EOS I remember him when he was God, how old was
he, about eleven or something like that EOS don’t even see him
anymore, he’s w- he’s like a bit emo, he’s got EOS is he? Is he? EOS
big hole in his ear, his hair’s a mess EOS he looks like a skunk
actually cos he’s dyed the ends blonde at some point EOS what, off
power rangers EOS power rangers? oh dear EOS erm actually, I think I
seen your Granddad actually when I was doing erm, when I was on the
cavity wall insulation EOS yeah, I think you said you went to try and
**inc** sell it off and EOS yeah, I like I knocked on his hou- I
knocked on- I knocked his house and erm I sa- I saw him go in the
house so I went, ‘oh, there’s Lewis’ Grandad’ EOS yeah EOS went to
knock on the house EOS no answer he just- EOS probably saw you down
the street, ‘oh, he’s trying to sell me summet’ EOS yeah, just- just
ignoring me EOS ahh don’t know how many brothers and sisters you got,
I think, no- EOS I’ve got one brother, one sister EOS I didn’t know
you had- oh yeah, I did I knew you had a brother, he’s a younger
brother isn’t he? EOS yeah EOS your sister older than you? EOS no, EOS
oh, right EOS me sister’s erm, sister’s seventeen EOS seventeen EOS
erm, - he’s nearly twenty one now EOS wow EOS yeah, he’s going aw-
he’s going on holiday for his birthday and erm in October EOS oh,
where’s he going? EOS he’s going to erm, is it Cos EOS Cos, yeah EOS
yeah, but he failed to invite me so EOS that was a bit cheeky wasn’t
it? EOS what, he’s just invited his mates? EOS yeah, just going with
all his mates cos he’s- he’s good mates with erm, you know everyone
that we work with at EOS oh yeah EOS erm, so he’s going with a lot of
them, all of his mates from- from erm from when he was a, you know,
doing his bricklaying EOS yeah EOS and stuff like that, so EOS is he
still doing that? EOS no, he’s just doing- he’s working at with us,
isn’t he EOS oh right, okay EOS erm, doing a bit of- he works more in
the kitchen and does a bit of driving work as well, you know like a
little bit of a EOS yeah EOS like assistant chef yeah EOS that’s cool
EOS so he’s not doing bad, but he said he wants to get back into the
erm, to the building but erm, the last- the last guy that he worked
for was an absolute arsehole EOS yeah EOS and erm, so he’s just put
him off, you know, like the guy lived in, up Bolton way EOS yeah EOS
and he used to have to be at this guys house for about erm, used to
have to be there for half six in the morning EOS Jee- yeah, I remember
you saying that EOS and this was before- this was before he could
drive EOS he had to get the train or something EOS so he had to like,
get the bus at like half five in the morning, and you know, if he was
late, the guy wouldn’t wait for him so EOS that’s horrible EOS I think
he just kind of thought ‘sack that, I’m not- I don’t wanna be working
in the bricklaying anymore’ sorta thing, but, but I’ve been trying to
tell him, you know, he needs to get back into it cos he can’t EOS yeah
EOS stay at ‘til forever and ever more, the longer you’re out of the
game, EOS yeah, you’ll **inc** it won’t you EOS the harder it’ll be to
get back into it EOS well he’s had his like, first job, so that’s the
hardest bit isn’t it, cos EOS yeah, definitely EOS when- then you can
get references EOS yeah EOS whereas our useless EOS yeah EOS he hasn’t
had a job yet he’s- well, he said he’s applied he d- he dropped out of
college EOS what college was he at? EOS he w- he w- he was at and then
he dropped out of that and I think he applied for EOS mm EOS and I
don’t think he went for the first day EOS and then just, didn’t go EOS
what was he doing at- at ? EOS erm, he was doing Computing, he was
doing, is it Cisco, is that what you were doing? EOS Cisco, yeah EOS
yeah, I think he was doing that, but he said the- the teachers are
wankers and EOS nah, yeah, it was basically- all it was, was erm,
online modules sorta- sorta thing EOS right EOS so we just used to sit
there in front of a computer for an hour just reading through these,
you know, all these modules EOS yeah, and then just doing the test EOS
and then, like, yeah, and then at the end of each module you have to
have a test and there was no sort of like teaching involved in it,
there was like, it was just, you know, you just sit there and read it,
I think the only thing we did erm, you know, practical stuff, cos it
was all to do with networking and computers and stuff like that, we
learnt how to, you know like y- when you get your Ethernet cables? EOS
yeah EOS we learnt how to make them EOS oh right, that’s alright EOS
and we learnt to strip a computer down, and then put it back together,
they were the only things we did for the whole two years EOS wow EOS
so, there’s no wonder I did- I didn’t erm, I didn’t pass it, cos when,
you like, you’d complete all your modules and then at the end of it
you have to take a EOS you know, like a test covering all the modules
EOS yeah EOS so, and then if you fail that test you have to pay for it
to do it again EOS oh my God EOS oh EOS so I failed it and I thought,
‘no’ EOS ‘I’m not even bothering’ EOS ‘I’m not- I’m not even going
back’ but you have- it’s like something like sixty pound a go EOS jeez
EOS and you know, back when I was working on four pound an hour in- in
Trafford Centre EOS sixty pound was quite a bit of money EOS how did
you do in your Electronics? EOS erm, Electronics in the end, I come
out with erm, a D EOS that’s good EOS so, better than nothing isn’t it
EOS yeah EOS erm, Music Technology, I only- I scrapped that after the
first year didn’t I EOS yeah, cos you pick four four equivalent
A-levels don’t you, and then drop one or something EOS well no,
basically I dropped it because it was, EOS **inc** EOS just- I just
didn’t like the tutors at all, like you know at- when I was in school
I was into all me drums and stuff EOS yeah EOS and I like loved music,
but then as soon as I got to college just, I don’t know what- I don’t
know what, but it’s just changed my, like erm, opinion of erm, you
know, trying to be a a musician sort of thing EOS oh, that’s a shame
EOS so yeah EOS I don’t regret it really though I was just too lazy to
practice enough EOS yeah EOS who’s your favourite high- high school
teacher then? EOS favourite high school teacher? EOS don’t think I had
one EOS I don’t- I don’t- I don’t think I had- I don’t think many
people- probably to be honest you know with Music EOS oh, yeah EOS he
was- EOS I- I rarely had him though, I had, what’s the other one
called, I think she was called or something but EOS I don’t remember
her EOS she- I think she was only there for like a year EOS yeah, I
know but cos- cos he was a drummer as well, you know, he like really
encouraged me and and erm, you know, he used to help me out wherever
he could EOS that’s cool EOS yeah I still see him about cos he works
for Salford Council now EOS right EOS you know for Ma- for Mapas,
Music and Performing Arts of Salford or something like that, erm, so
I- I see him about, you know when I’m dropping stuff off at different
places EOS yeah EOS so I still speak to him now and again he was erm,
decent do you- what was the worst thing you ever got into trouble for
at school? EOS it probably wasn’t the worst thing but he really
annoyed me, he was erm in RE he was our RE teacher, I can’t remember
if it was a woman she was- EOS no idea EOS she was horrible, but EOS
it was one of them subjects that you just don’t pay attention to EOS
yeah, she complained at me for me handwriting at some- at one week or
something, and then the next week she gave me detention cos me
handwriting was still bad and I’m like EOS ‘what’ EOS ahh, the worst-
I got in trouble for a couple of things, when we was in erm, year
seven erm, I thought I’d be a bit with erm, itching powder EOS oh,
yeah EOS thought I’d be a little bit of erm, mischievous erm and then
me and , me and and used to all mess about in erm, in Science class,
this was year ten, year ten or eleven EOS yeah EOS we always used to
mess about in Science and erm, basically you know along the Science
benches EOS yeah EOS used to get like the wooden bits along the front,
and snapped one off EOS so of course, you heard this like big cracking
sound EOS teacher looks across to us all and we’re all there, like
rolling our eyes EOS and the next- so he turns back, carries on with
what- what he’s doing and the next thing you know, I’ve got this piece
of wood in me hand and just head-butts it EOS like, snaps it in half,
and then the teacher looks round again, and I’m sat there with like
two pi- two pieces of wood in my hand EOS and erm, we both got te-
detention for that and erm, you remember ? EOS yeah EOS Science
teacher EOS yeah, oh, EOS we- yeah, we- we were in erm, doing
detention and he- and he comes in and he goes, ‘surprised to see you
here lads, wh- what you in here for?’ and, you know what like, he just
like burst out laughing, and I’m just sat there dead straight faced
and he just went, ‘smashed a piece of wood over his head’ EOS like
that it’s what it is- but that was one of worst things I ever got in
de- in trouble for I reckon so are your Mum and Dad from Salford? From
Manchester area? EOS erm my Mum grew up where my Gran and Granddad are
now EOS are they in still, in EOS in, yeah, erm, my Dad grew up in EOS
right, still Manchester area EOS yeah, but , stepdad, I think his
Mum’s part Prussian- Persian- Prussian- EOS Prussian EOS is it East
German or summet? EOS yeah EOS or, on the edge of something and then
he lives- he lived in Wales, and in Liverpool EOS and then he moved
over here so he’s got the weirdest accent EOS it’s like, he doesn’t-
he went to the chippy and I was like, ‘ah, get us a chip barm’, he
went, ‘what’s a chip barm?’, ‘like, you know, barm, with chips in it’
EOS he was like, ‘don’t have a clue what you’re on about’ EOS I showed
it him, and he went, ‘oh, that’s a chip batch’ EOS a chip batch? EOS
like, what’s a batch? EOS ah, people from other places, they call it
weird things don’t they EOS they do EOS it’s like, you know like I’ve
got family that live in, in erm, in Southend EOS yeah EOS they- they
erm, they’re baffled by, literally, you know like Peter Kay says it
on- on his thingy, but they are baffled by like chips and gravy EOS
they just don’t have it like, my- my Aunty who’s from up here, erm,
EOS she has it all the time but like, the kids they don’t eat it, I
love chips and gravy EOS yeah, it’s the best meal EOS and every time
you go down and you’re like, you know, if you go to the chippy, ‘can I
have chips and gravy’ they’ll just give you like, a portion of chips
and a portion of gravy, they won’t give it you together, if- if you
want to eat it now EOS mm, yeah EOS really? That’s well weird, ah
where’s your favourite chippy? EOS In Salford? EOS chippy erm EOS I
can only think of two there’s or EOS definitely, EOS yeah EOS the salt
and pepper chips they’re nice EOS they’re nice EOS erm EOS there’s
one- EOS but the one on, you know on the , what’s it called now, it’s
a Chinese chippy on erm, you know on the ? EOS yeah used to go there
school EOS yeah, the one right at the end EOS yeah EOS yeah, I can’t
remember what it’s called now, not been there for a while but that’s
nice as well what was your erm, what was your first job after leaving
school? EOS I worked in Costa Coffee EOS oh you did, didn’t you? EOS
yeah EOS working with and that EOS nah, it wasn’t with - EOS you
worked in Trafford Centre didn’t you? EOS yeah, I was at the Trafford
Centre one EOS God, I forgot about that EOS cos that, well, it’s like,
went up to the manager and it’s like, ‘oh, I was thinking like, I want
a job, erm, can I have an interview or something’ he’s like EOS ‘oh
yeah, just come down’, cos like I didn’t have to give my CV in or
anything EOS yeah EOS I went down, and he- he- he just went, ‘do you
know what, I like you’ EOS he’s like, ‘you can have a job’ turned out
he was a raving nutter, but EOS really EOS he, yeah, he didn’t hire
anybody else on and then he had a like a mental breakdown or
something, so there’s like, only six of us who work there, like I
think the hours were something like eight ‘til ten everyday, and then
he left, and it was just like us fending for ourselves EOS it was
horrendous EOS that in the Trafford Centre, yeah? EOS yeah EOS bloody
hell, I remember my- my first job working in- in Trafford, I went to
you know when the job- when the job centre used to behin- be behind
the big screen EOS yeah EOS do you remember when it used to be there?
EOS yeah EOS I went in there, you know, like looking for jobs and- and
the guy that- that was erm running it, sort of thing he said, ‘yeah,
they’ve got this one in BHS here’ erm, you know, ‘fill out this
application form’, so I filled it out EOS and he said that there’s
supposed to be a questionnaire to go with it EOS yeah EOS you know
that, you know, to see what your opinions are on stuff, he said,
‘we’ve not got an- any in at the moment but erm, when it comes in I’ll
fill it out for you and hand it in’ EOS ace EOS and then, so I- I- I
ended up erm getting- going- going for the interview erm, getting the
job EOS **inc** EOS I don’t- I don’t remem- I don’t remember if I’ve
told you this but you know when you go for your induction sort of
thing EOS yeah EOS erm, there was- there was about eight or ten of us
sat round this big table, and it was near- near the Christmas erm,
period when I first started EOS yeah EOS so they had some of the
things that they used to sell on Christmas shop EOS ahh EOS and erm,
no word of a lie, they had a vibrator on the table EOS why? EOS so we
were all sat there going ‘what kind of, erm, company have we come to
work for here?’ EOS was it a Christmassy one? EOS yeah, the- I don’t-
I can’t- I honestly can’t remember EOS but- and when like, the
Christmas shop came in they used to sell like, you know, like adult
stuff like that, like flavoured EOS yeah EOS condoms and everything
like that, which was kind of weird, when you’re only EOS sixteen and
you’re like EOS I don’t think I applied to work in Ann Summers EOS erm
EOS what was your favourite subject, like, of all time, apart from
Music EOS apart from Music? God I loved History when I was at school
EOS oh, we had- what’s he called, that teacher, the ginger one? EOS
oh, he was quality EOS yeah, he was- he was a good History tea- and we
had erm, what was the other one called as well? The one that really
pale with black hair, the woman EOS ahh, no- no I’m thinking of a man
I think he was the Geography one EOS **inc** EOS or something, no- he
was Science wasn’t he EOS , yeah, and EOS yeah EOS I don’t know who
she was EOS what was she called, , was that the one? And she got
married didn’t she? EOS I remember the name, but I don’t think I ever
had her EOS yeah, yeah, she wasn’t bad either but yeah I used to love
erm, History and History and Music was about it really, everything
else I just used to loathe EOS yeah EOS what about you? EOS oh, I
like, I liked the Sciencey ones but I didn’t like the teachers EOS
yeah, Science was okay but EOS and I didn’t like Maths either, was
like, really geeky in it EOS no EOS but EOS I didn’t like Maths, we
had erm, is it EOS oh, she was horrendous EOS she was EOS we had at
first, and she just used to shout at me for just being in me bag all
the time EOS it’s just, like- it wasn’t in it, I just had it open, I
was asleep on the desk with me head in it EOS but yeah, and erm, cos
me and used to sit next to each other EOS I can imagine EOS so and it
was, you know, right near the back of the class so we were always up
to no good EOS and yeah, just, so she just used to- she never used to
like us I don’t think so that didn’t make it any better but yeah,
Science, I reckon cos it was a pretty run down school by the- by the
time we was there EOS it was shocking, wasn’t it? EOS so they never
used to have any Science equipment L; they had Bunsen burners, that
was it, EOS Bunsen bur- Bunsen burners EOS but we were banned from
them, cos we always used to set things on fire EOS and the clay mats
that were all like superglued back together EOS cause people had been
smashing them EOS so yeah what else, what else, what else, what else,
can you remember any good stories that your grandparents or your
parents used to tell you? EOS no, they’re all crap EOS they just tell
you rubbish, don’t they, like if I start talking to my Gran she’ll-
she just won’t shut up EOS yeah EOS she’ll just carry on, she’ll get
slightly on a tangent, and then she’ll move straight onto it, and
then- EOS I think a lot of Gran’s are like that aren’t they EOS go in
a circle well EOS cause my- my Gran, cos she lives down in Southend
with my Aunty and erm, so she- all the time she’s on the phone to me
Mum and me Mum’s sat there like that you know, trying to get off the
phone cos she’s just going on, and on, and on EOS it’s really hard as
well isn’t it, cos they don’t give you a break EOS I know you c- you
can’t tell them- you can’t tell them to you know, you don’t know what
to EOS ‘hanging up now, bye’ EOS yeah, ‘I’ve got to go now’, ‘just a
minute, just a minute’ EOS ‘just let me tell you this’ EOS ‘me
kitchen’s on fire, can I go?’, ‘no’ EOS yeah she phoned up the other
night, you know when all these riots were on, on the precinct EOS yeah
EOS she phoned up to see if me Dad was working but erm, he wasn’t
thankfully, he answered the phone going, ‘hold on a minute, hold on a
minute, erm, I’m just beating these muggers off from the door’ EOS
she’s dead- she’s dead- EOS he’s a firefighter your Dad isn’t he? EOS
yeah, fireman, yeah I always remember random stories he used to tell
me when- when I was a kid but the one that sticks out most is just
like when, he’s got a picture of it actually, w- him and one of his,
erm, the lads that he first started working with, erm like, this
building’s on fire and there’s just got a picture of them ru- both
running away from this bi- w- brick wall that’s collapsing behind them
EOS woah EOS that was pretty- pretty cool erm, picture and story to go
with it EOS my Mum’s just a bit of a looser, eh, you know her don’t
you? EOS yeah EOS erm EOS do you see her that often with your job now
cos, before when you were first doing in you her saw quite a lot when
she worked on didn’t you cos you did some of the- EOS y- yeah, erm,
EOS I’ve not seen her for a while actually, erm, you know, cos with
all the council cuts EOS yeah EOS well, everything’s been scaled back,
I mean, when I first started doing the driving erm, you know, we used
to be really busy everyday, you know, like with like ten or twelve
jobs to do everyday, but now, we’re down to about two or three EOS
**inc** EOS you know, on a good day you’ll be like, you’ll have like
one big job for like eighty people and that’s considered a busy day
now EOS woah EOS whereas like, back when we first started you know,
used to do like six jobs for twenty people, so so it has- it has erm,
you know, been scaled back a lot with all the cuts so it’s kind of
erm, no, I don’t see- I don’t see- I’ve not seen her for a while I
don’t think- she’s not been to- up to for a while I don’t- EOS yeah,
well, she used to work at but then she moved to round the corner so
I’m not sure they do the same sort of thing EOS right what d- what-
yeah, what like, what years does she teach sort of thing EOS she’s
early so it’s nursery mainly EOS but sometimes she does a bit of
reception EOS yeah, my Mum teaches erm, like reception she just erm,
their school’s just been closed down and th- you know, they’ve got a
new one EOS yep EOS erm, what’s it called, ‘’ or something like that
EOS oh, yeah, that’s where goes EOS no EOS no, not erm, EOS it’s-
that’s what Seedy went to, wasn’t it EOS , right EOS it’s called, erm,
it’s down by the river believe it or not EOS erm, so yeah, th- do you
know the school where she worked erm, EOS yeah EOS it’s like, hundred
and fifteen years old or something like that EOS woah EOS and it is
like, falling apart EOS you know, you so it’s about time they got a
new one, I think they’re, you know, merging a couple of schools EOS
yeah EOS like they did- EOS they’re doing that everywhere aren’t they?
EOS yeah, like they did with ours when EOS I think it’s horrendous EOS
was it- was it that closed wasn’t it, EOS yeah EOS and they merged-
EOS some dodgy Broughton people living here EOS merged some of ours
and some with- with bad times, when they- all the scrotes come EOS
yeah EOS erm EOS did you ever- ever get hurt when you was playing as a
kid? EOS ever get hurt? No, I- I’ve never broke a bone in my body EOS
really? Wow EOS yeah erm, the worst thing that’s ever happened, and it
sounds really naff, is erm, just pushing my, you know, like a push
bike EOS yeah EOS along, and erm, for some reason this- this lad that
used to live round the corner, erm, he come up and he was just- just
messing about like, just like kicked the back tyre, sort of thing, and
you know the- the cogs where your chain goes EOS yeah EOS like, dug
right into my leg so, got a big- big scar on my leg where that was
from EOS ahh EOS I had to go hospital and have stitches for that, that
was about the worst thing that ever- ever happened to me EOS ahh we
had erm, the old Scouts, some of them were like messing around in our
house EOS y- yeah EOS cos like, legged it to the back door to like try
and lock them out, just messing about, and I ran past the ironing
board and kicked the leg of it EOS ooh EOS and broke me toe EOS ooh oh
EOS that was probably the worst I did, erm, I fell out a tree at one
point and cracked me elbow like, cracked the bone in it EOS yeah EOS
ah, but, I wasn’t that bad cos- EOS no, I don’t think- EOS you don’t
really use it much EOS I think I’ve had a couple of burns and stuff
when I was a kid but nothing nothing worth speaking about really, just
the EOS scar on my leg from an idiot down the street EOS erm,
whereabouts did you used to play when you- when you were a kid? EOS
erm, well we used to live in - EOS did you? EOS yeah, erm, so there
was erm, just some like- where all the houses go round, there was like
a little patch in the middle which was just like, gravel EOS yeah EOS
used to play in there a lot but it’s just- it was just full of crap,
like, what- bits of broken wood with nails in it, used to go back with
EOS oh EOS bit of wood with a nail in your foot EOS yeah EOS so EOS my
brother’s done that Mum was like, ‘oh, gotta take you to hospital for
a tetanus’ and all this EOS get over it Mum, EOS just wipe it up with
an alcohol free wipe EOS but we used to have erm, where I used to live
on erm, do you remember the Church on the- on the- on the high- EOS no
EOS it was like a really old old church, like, pretty big church EOS
yeah EOS and we used to play on the grounds there but then they
knocked it all down and built houses over it erm, with like a- just a
smaller church to the side and we used to just like, used to have
like, you know like the massive fences along, erm EOS yeah EOS so- but
we dug like a little hole so we could s- like slide under the- under
the fence EOS and we built a little tree house in the- in the corner
EOS ahh, that’s well cool EOS and erm, we used to get the vicar coming
out, you know, like, shouting at us, going, ‘get off’ and, you know,
private land EOS and obviously, playing in- never went down to Buille
Hill Park really, but like, Oaks Park EOS yeah, Lightoaks is a lot
nicer isn’t it? EOS y- EOS it’s got its little pond in it EOS yeah,
but erm, I remem- I remember learning to ride my bike in- in Buille
Hill park though EOS oh, I remember that, yeah, my Granddad used to
go- round the park with us, and you used to have your stabilisers on
EOS yeah EOS tried it with stabilisers and now I couldn’t do it, EOS
but, like, I was like, ‘I really want to ride it without the
stabilisers’ but every time he tried I just fell off, and then one
day, one of the stabilisers fell off EOS yeah EOS like, on its own
accord, I was like, ‘fine’, so, he took the other one off I thought it
was pretty good EOS really? I remember when my Dad who’s like, you
know, like running along behind, holding the seat so I wouldn’t
wobble, and then EOS yeah EOS I just remember going, ‘w- why am I
wobbling so much g- get hold of the seat’, and tu- turned around an me
Dad was like EOS miles away EOS a- miles away, I’d been riding the
bike and I didn’t- you know, didn’t even know that’s the first time I
remember EOS if you could talk to your young self now you could say,
‘centrifugal inertia, and you can pedal faster and you’ll be alright’
EOS yeah ahh, they talk about that word all the time don’t they EOS
it’s true though like when- like on me bike when I’m going round
corners, you know, or j- or like you’re trying to do a u- turn, the
faster y- you, obviously not like twenty mile an hour but, EOS yeah
EOS the faster you’re going, then it- the easier it is to manoeuvre it
EOS did you ever do any extra extra activities at erm, in school or
college when we used to have to do erm, EOS ah EOS what was it called
now? EOS I did circus skills with EOS circus skills with- EOS I did a
bit of that EOS what did I do? I think I used to do something with
music, you know erm, learning to play another instrument, I started to
learn how to play guitar but you know, drums was the way forward for
me, thought, ‘chords, what are these?’ EOS didn’t have a clue EOS I
did do boules at erm, High School EOS oh yeah, I remember - was it EOS
yeah, he was a right weirdo EOS he u- he used to teach that didn’t he
EOS yeah, was pretty good actually, enjoyed that EOS yeah EOS I was
rubbish at it EOS I don’t think I ever used to do anything in- in a
High School EOS there wasn’t really much to do was there EOS no, I
used to play a lit- little bit of rugby but I never stuck at it really
EOS no EOS you know, cos my Dad used to play, my Dad used to play for
erm, Salford Reds Juniors EOS really? EOS and he erm, did like tours
in France and Germany and all that when they were- when he was like,
when he was like nineteen, twenty erm, he did like you know, like
tours in France and stuff, and I remember him always telling me about
the coach got erm, you know, got taken ill EOS yeah EOS and erm, him
and one of his mates decided to stay in France with him EOS you know,
while he got better EOS quality EOS so they just had a hol- they just
had like a EOS piss up EOS think it was like a three or four week
holiday just messing about, something like that EOS that’s well good
what do you think of the local people in your hometown? EOS what, in
Salford? EOS yeah EOS well, after erm, was it Tuesdays EOS erm,
incidents, not a lot really EOS it was just a small minority of it,
spoiling it for people wasn’t it? EOS it was EOS was anything bad near
you? EOS I live- I live fairly near to the Salford precinct where it
was- EOS really EOS all taking place, you could see, there was a
couple of cars on f- that they’d burnt out, think it was like the
Manchester Radio car EOS yeah EOS erm, then they’d, you know like,
tipped it over and burnt it out, you could see the smoke for miles
erm, and my girlfriend, she’s like, nosey EOS so we- so we had to go
for a drive round didn’t we EOS so we went for a li- for a little
drive round and you know, like all the roads to the precinct there’s
just like, lines of li- riot police EOS gosh EOS erm, and they all
looked knackered EOS they’d been stood there for ages EOS yeah EOS you
know, without a break, felt sorry for them, one of my Mum’s friends
erm, he works erm, you know, training and co-ordinating the riot
police EOS yeah EOS so he was- he was like up for like forty-eight
hours straight or something daft like that EOS jeez EOS it was erm- it
was all madness wasn’t it though, but I think there’s erm, like I say,
just a lot of people spoiling it for the majority, a lot of people in
Salford are decent people EOS yeah EOS erm, just erm, what was it- cos
I was watching erm is it Question Time with young voters last night
and erm, it was saying that, you know, there’s a lot of erm EOS you
know, it’s not just people you know, being idiots, there is a lot of
underlying problems that they think is the cause EOS yeah EOS there
are broken families and all this erm, did you hear what H- Hazel
Blears said? In h- EOS ahh, I was listening on the radio, I wanted to
turn it off she just- so irritating EOS in erm, was it in the houses
of parliament where she said erm, you know, ‘why aren’t- why aren’t
your kids in school’ and it’s like, it’s the summer holidays EOS ahh,
but erm, watching- watching the news as well with- I’m sure the- the
news people just go around and find the most stupid people to talk to
EOS I know, they do EOS the stupidest people to talk to and, you know,
give interviews to and, you know, you can see why half of them haven’t
got jobs EOS yeah EOS the way- the way they talk and act EOS there was
one that I was listening to and he- he’s like this black guy and he-
he was like, ‘so, why are you rioting’, and he went, ‘oh, it’s just
the police, I hate the police, cos they- they hate us, they can’t
stand the colour of our skin, we’re like, black and Asian and they
don’t even care about their own colour skin’, EOS it’s like, they’re
not being racist then are they, they’re just, indiscriminant EOS like
you, plad EOS they’re just- they’re just stupid aren’t they see that
guy that was in Manchester city centre with his erm, with his t-shirt
pulled up over his face and his- and his sunglasses on, and he was
like, ‘the police can’t touch us today can they it’s free reign’
thought, ‘oh’ I was just watching it and I was thinking ‘why?’ EOS
what’s the point EOS what are they- what do they think they’re gonna
achieve, you know, if they wanted to vent their anger I’m sure they
would find better ways than erm, smashing up their own communities did
you hear erm, TJ Hughes on the precinct, the- they’ve closed it down
now EOS have they, oh EOS because erm, you know cos it got that badly
damaged in the riots EOS yeah EOS erm, they just decided that they
can’t afford to erm, you know, repair it all, so they’ve just closed
it down, so they’re just ruining prospects for people in their own
community really aren’t they? EOS yeah EOS you know, that’s about, how
many people do you reckon are working there, fifteen, twenty people,
that’ve just lost their jobs EOS they now are jobless, yeah EOS so
they’re just adding to their own problems and- they just don’t think
about it do they EOS it’s erm, it’s all stupid I d- I don’t see why
they were rioting anyway, I think they were just EOS just any excuse
for them EOS copy- copy cat riots from, you know, cos I think in
London it was all to do with that guy getting shot wasn’t it EOS yeah
EOS erm, but up here, they j- they had no reason at all did they
really, EOS no EOS they were just copying it, getting away with it cos
th- you know, because they could get away with it so but erm, watching
a few erm, videos you know, that have been posted on youtube of people
getting arrested EOS and erm, what do you reckon- what do you reckon
about erm, you know, if people do get convicted then they should loose
their benefits EOS I reckon that’s quality, and loose their house,
everything EOS mm EOS that’s a good idea EOS at- see I- at first I- I
thought that, you know, yeah, cos they shouldn’t have been involved in
the riots and why should the tax payer have to, you know, pay for the
clean up EOS pay for all the damage, yeah EOS and pay for them who
have caused the mess EOS yeah EOS but then I was watching when I was
watching the- that programme last night and it was saying, you know,
erm, is it not just EOS gonna cos more problems cos these people that
are already on low incomes or no incomes have got, you know, nowhere
to go, so are they not just gonna start causing more trouble than all
this EOS yeah EOS so, there’s a bit of a argument for both sides of it
really isn’t there **inc**- EOS deport them EOS deport them, yeah L;
yeah, send them all somewhere else EOS mm EOS just make them live on a
small island EOS or Australia, like back in the day EOS execute them
EOS did you see that about the- was it that e-petitions where they’re
trying to get erm, you know, the death sentence brought back sort of
thing EOS yeah EOS aren’t they all mad aren’t they? EOS well, I think
it’d be quite good cos it’ll get like- jail’s like blocked up anyway
EOS yeah EOS if you get one’s that are stuck there for life anyway,
what’s the point in them being around EOS that’s very true very true
erm I don’t think it’ll deter anybody though cos, you can imagine, in
America they still have high crime rates, it doesn’t really deter
anybody does it EOS no, I suppose not EOS with- with criminals it’s
erm, when they’re committing acts of, whatever EOS erm, they don’t
really think about the consequences do they, EOS no EOS they don’t
think, ‘oh, I’m gonna get banged up for twenty years for smuggling ten
pound- ten million pounds worth of class A’ or whatever they just want
to do it because they’re greedy aren’t they, or- EOS yeah, but if they
do get rid of them then we’re not paying to house them in jails as
well, so it’ll make it cheaper for us EOS mmhmm EOS should bring back
the cane in schools, and let police beat everyone up it’ll be great
EOS that’s another one of the topics that was on that programme last
night, he was saying that, you know, how can you expect these, you
know, these kids, to respect the police when- EOS they can’t- the
police can’t do anything EOS they don’t even respect- they don’t even
respect their own Mums’ and Dads’ EOS yeah EOS and you’re taking the
powers away from the- from the Mums’ and Dads’ to, you know, enforce
that respect, because you know, even smacking a child is frowned upon
and EOS yeah EOS stuff isn’t it, you were saying that- EOS can’t shout
at anyone without ending up in prison EOS yeah, yeah, too erm, too
P-C, politically correct, isn’t it, you know it’s all- EOS it’s human
rights and all that crap EOS bollocks in my opinion EOS yeah EOS never
did me any harm EOS no, it’s good EOS get- getting a smack round the
back of the legs EOS oh, I always thought back of the head was worse
EOS no, no, trust me, the back of the legs was worse you know,
especially coming from my Dad EOS I can imagine EOS he’s massive isn’t
he? EOS yeah EOS that was erm, fun times when I was a kid, well I d- I
don’t get people that, you know, it’s never aff- it’s never affected
me in- in any way, any- anybody that I know that got you know, a clip
round the ear once in a while EOS yeah EOS you know, it’s not affected
them in you know, like, adversely sort of- sort of way has it, you
know EOS I suppose they’re trying to protect people who are constantly
abused but, EOS yeah, but EOS if they’re gonna be constantly abused
then they’re just gonna be constantly- like, putting a rule in saying
‘you can’t hit your kids’ isn’t gonna stop them EOS yeah, there should
be- I think they need to look at it don’t they change the rules EOS
they do EOS so have you- I don’t know what erm- what ways did you have
to help around- EOS help around the house when you used to live at
home with your Mam? EOS erm, I dunno, my Mum was more of a slob than
us, so it wasn’t too bad, but you know what my Mum’s like, she’s she
only did like, the pots and the tea every now and again, EOS yeah EOS
it didn’t really matter to be honest, we were more we all did our bit
and that EOS aha, yeah EOS you have to do anything? EOS used to- used
to be like a fight in our house every weekend, you know, like me Mum
dragging us out of bed at like ten o’clock on a Saturday morning when
you just wanna sleep EOS really EOS cos you’ve been up like playing on
your Xbox or whatever, ‘til like three in the morning EOS she’s
dragging us out of bed going, erm, trying to get us, you know, to tidy
up different things like, you can wash the pots from last night and
she used to make us like al- hoover all the- hoover all the- all the
stairs and landing and clean the bathroom and stuff like that EOS ah,
my Mum was pretty cool with all that, I think she did most of it EOS
yeah EOS think she just erm, made us clean our rooms, and any mess
that we left out she, like, we cleaned that up EOS yeah EOS but she
did the rest EOS she w- the funniest I look back on it now and I- I- I
l- laugh on it, but when- when we were kids, like cos me and my
brother used to have to share a room, erm, if that you know, became,
messer, and me Dad used to warn us, like two, or three times you know,
saying, you know, ‘tidy your room up’ EOS yeah EOS and then if we
didn’t do it, you know, just go, ‘oh you know, we’ll just leave it, do
it another time’, erm, we’d come home from school one day and he would
like have ripped everything out of the wardrobes, all the toy boxes
would be emptied EOS you know, just everything in a big pile in the
middle of the floor and he’d just go EOS ‘sort it out’ EOS ‘sort it
out now’ y- you know, ‘you’re not going out until you’ve tidied your
room’ so we used to have to sit there for like you know, three hours,
just EOS that’s quite good that EOS tidying the room, and then it used
to be spotless for about two months, but then it used to get back to
the same thing EOS that’s why- but my room now you know, it’s always
spotless so I think that’s been drilled into me, you know EOS mine
would be if wasn’t in it all the time EOS oh, God EOS she’s so messy
EOS every time comes ro- eve- every time comes round to ours, you
know, it just- it’ll be, you know, there’ll be a few clothes you know,
on the back of the chair or whatever, but she’ll just like, throw her
bag on the floor, her shoes and everything and EOS ah, it annoys me
you know, just spent half an hour cleaning up and then you come round
and erm, mess everything up EOS yeah, I live at me own in at the
moment, and it’s just bliss, it’s just like, nobody makes a mess EOS
yeah EOS and then, if I make a mess I clean it up like pretty much
straight away anyway so EOS that’d be ace erm EOS I do miss like but
she comes round and visits me, and I’m round here more than anything,
I think EOS yeah at least you’ve got her your car, how’s your car
doing? EOS yeah, it’s alright, you can- like, it looks like there’s a
really, really clean patch just on this wheel arch where I managed to
scrape it up the wall EOS and it’s just got a different coloured paint
on at the moment EOS oh it’s only like a little scratch, but, yeah,
it’s alright EOS mm EOS I’ve had a erm, just had me car insurance EOS
renewed EOS how much- EOS but I pay it in one EOS how much? EOS it was
well, the renewal price was one, six then erm, I changed to Admiral
for like an ultra low mileage EOS yeah EOS so, and then it got it down
to one, four, and then I put on it, and it went- knocked it down to
one three I was like EOS that’s weird isn’t it? EOS that’s brill, but
they’ve now got a tracker in it to check my mileage EOS you’ve got to
have a tracker on it? EOS I’ve got it on it, yeah but it’s- all they
do is just check how many miles you do in the year, and if you go over
then you gotta pay a premium cos I said I’ll only do five thousand
miles EOS yeah EOS which is why it went cheaper but if my car ever
gets stolen or anything I can like phone them up and say, ‘can you
just- my car’s been stolen can you-’ EOS track it sort of thing EOS
yeah, turn the tracker on EOS that’s a- that’s a- that’s alright isn’t
it? EOS and then they give it all to the police, and the police go and
find it EOS that’s decent my bike’s got so many cracks down the side
of it where the previous owner dropped it on the floor EOS ahh, have
you not like, dropped it or anything yet, EOS nope not dropped it at-
I- I came off it in EOS I can’t see any cracks actually EOS it’s on
the- it’s on the other side I came off it in erm EOS in Buille Hill
park luckily, EOS yeah EOS you know on the grass EOS yeah EOS so that
was the only time I’ve fell off it so far erm, and it was actually
quite funny, I got up laughing to myself just going, ‘oh my God’ EOS
but yeah, there’s like big cracks down the side of it and you can see
where, like it was been painted over sort of thing, but it’s like, cos
it’s like, it’s like shiny isn’t it EOS yeah EOS but, on the other- on
the other side, erm, it’s just like matte, matte blue paint EOS ahh
EOS and it just looks stupid erm, but I can’t complain for what I paid
for it and the mileage on it there’s still- it’s not even got a
thousand miles on the clock yet EOS has it not EOS mm EOS wow EOS ah,
it’s great for, you know, just going back and forward to work you
know, takes me like, well, not half the time, but you know, depends
what time, if I’ve gotta go you know, down to at you know like five
o’clock and it’s really busy, just zipping through EOS mm, weaving EOS
zipping through the traffic is pretty cool, but did I tell you- did I
tell you about that argument what I had with that van driver? EOS I
think you did EOS yeah, I was like just – EOS oh, you were going past
weren’t you? EOS yeah, I was ju- I was just like going past the line
of traffic and I stopped to let him- to let him come past on the other
side of the road, and erm, he starts shake- shaking his head at me
going, you know, like mouthing off in his van going, ‘ah, what you
doing this for, what you doing this for?’ EOS so I was just like you
know, g- give him the fingers EOS and he pulled up at the side of me
there, and he was like proper screaming in my face going, ‘why don’t
you get to the back of the queue, all these other people have gotta
wait’ and I was like, EOS ‘I’m on a bike’ EOS it’s part an- ‘part and
parcel of having a motorbike to be honest with you mate, you know, I’m
not gonna sit in a queue of traffic when I can just overtake everbody
am I’ EOS no EOS oh, gotta think- EOS I really want a motorbike now,
what? EOS gotta think- gotta think sometimes erm, have you not thought
more about getting yours? EOS I have but it’s EOS are you gonna wait a
couple of years do you reckon? EOS yeah, probably until like, we get
our own place and that, cos EOS yeah cos I reckon- you probably need a
garage to store it in, to EOS yeah EOS to save it from getting nicked
EOS I could put it in the back garden at the moment, but EOS mm EOS
it’s cost as well EOS yeah EOS if I could get rid of my car then I
would, but I can’t for EOS no, well if you- if you, you know, cos I
know, the reason I got rid of my car was cos the insurance was just
was too high EOS yeah EOS you know, I think I was paying two thousand
pound, and it was only a little fiat punto EOS yeah EOS so I thought,
you know what, erm, this doesn’t justify it, you know, I only travel,
you know, n- not far to work do I, I walk to work most days, so I just
got rid of it and got that cos it’s cheap as chips to run, three
hundred and fifty pound a year on me insurance EOS that’s quality EOS
and erm EOS my tax is nearly that, road tax what was your road- EOS
how much- how much is your tax for a year? EOS oh, it’s about two
hundred and fifty five I think EOS bloody hell, do you know how much
it is on that EOS it’s probably about five or something- EOS fif-
fifteen pounds for the year EOS fifteen, ahh EOS don’t laugh, it’s not
funny EOS ahh yeah EOS no, it is well worth it, I would do it, but I
need a car to get **inc** EOS yeah, it can be- it can be a bit of a-
EOS a pain in the arse, you know when it’s raining or it’s a little
bit cold, but EOS yeah wait ‘til snow comes in winter- EOS well I’ve
been- I’ve been riding it since the middle of- since the middle of
January, so EOS oh, right EOS you know, I’ve been out- I’ve been out
there in the cold and- and everything like that, you know, with me
long johns on EOS underneath me thermals so, I erm, I can, I’ll be-
plan to be riding it until it starts snowing and getting icy, so, then
it’ll go in the garage until I can get it out again EOS yeah EOS oh,
depends on the job front, I might get a car but the insurance-
insurance EOS a cheap one, insure it for a month or something? EOS
insure it- yeah, just insure it for a month EOS get on EOS erm, I’m
al- I’m already on EOS oh, that’s good EOS but, you know, she uses it
for work going back and forward to Swinton every day told her to get a
motorbike but she won’t have any of it EOS I can imagine on a
motorbike EOS ah EOS I told her, you know, it won’t cost you anything
EOS get her a sidecar for yours EOS yeah You need to count to five. EOS One, two, three, four, five. EOS And
Veronica . EOS go on, it’s gonna be horrible this EOS Go on! EOS One,
two, three, four, five. EOS Yeah that’s fine, okay off you go EOS
Okay. EOS Er were there lots of kids with you when you were playing
up? Playing up, growing up EOS Er not partic- not particularly cos I
lived like down one of the back streets, so I think there was about
six kids on our road and they were all different ages but we all still
played together. EOS Oh that’s- that’s nice EOS what was the best or
funniest memory from when you were young? EOS Erm funniest? I can’t
think of a funny time EOS Erm oh when me and and like they were my
best friends when I was really young and we were having a sleep over
at mine. It’s not gonna sound funny now EOS but erm having a sleepover
at mine and I used to have big glass doors going into the
conservatory. EOS yeah EOS And we pulled the curtains across while
went upstairs and closed the doors and erm she was running away from
something and ran straight into the doors EOS oh no EOS and onto the
floor it was very funny at the time EOS What was yours erm funniest
childhood memory then? EOS I don’t think erm- I don’t remem- remember
having much memories of when I was a kid actually. EOS I genuinely
don’t, I think I took too many knocks on my head when I was younger
EOS aww E: I think one of the best ones is that- Mum told me the other
day, it was when she used to go down to spa at she used to put me in
my little trike, and I used to- she said I used to just cycle along
like this, going crazy with the li- the shopping in the front basket,
EOS aww EOS just going, peddling and peddling and peddling. I used to
think I was superman **inc** EOS So fast going everywhere, used to run
everywhere. EOS yeah EOS How many sis- how many brothers and sisters
do you have, do you get- EOS Er two sisters. EOS Do you get along? EOS
no. EOS No . EOS Well we do at times like we have our moments. We love
each other on days and hate each other on other days. EOS Just cos we
share a room I think it gets a bit intense at times. EOS yeah EOS It’s
not too bad though is it? You just argue a hell of a lot EOS and
you’re all stubborn, it’s well annoying EOS What funny things are
there to do in your community? Not funny, fun EOS What- what did you
say? There’s not a lot to do but now like we’ve all got a bit older
and we can all start driving and stuff, we can obviously go further
away and there’s obviously quite a lot of things to do. Bit of golf
when it gets a bit boring. EOS But no-one- no-one ever goes down with
me EOS You’re obsessed now with the driving range EOS There’s football
and stuff but whatever floats your boat really. I’m easily entertained
I think. Erm are you going on holiday this year? EOS Yeah with you !
EOS where are you going? EOS We’re going erm, to Catalonia in Greece.
EOS Catalonia. EOS yeah EOS yeah EOS What, isn’t it Catalonia? EOS
Yeah. EOS What’s it called? EOS You said Cat- you said Catalonia. EOS
Catalonia. EOS It’s Catalonia, just- carry on! EOS anyway we’re going
Catalonia, EOS ruining it EOS on Tuesday for a week. EOS Erm it’s got
like the blue lagoon and stuff and nice beaches and turtle beaches.
EOS very nice EOS Hopefully it’ll be good weather for us. EOS Yeah.
EOS It’s ninety at the minute. EOS wow EOS Ooh- ooh, can’t wait! Er
what extra activities did you get involved in at school? EOS Erm
trampolining at . Er we did- that’s all I ever did trampolining and
dance EOS were you a boring kid when you were growing up? EOS I wasn’t
boring I was just er had other things to do. EOS Such as? EOS shut up!
EOS No you say something you got to elaborate on it. EOS What extra
curricular activities did you do? EOS Erm, depends at primary school
there wasn’t much to do so I just did erm, played a bit of- dabbled in
a bit of rounders and EOS ooh EOS and then realised it’s for girls and
then started playing football more. And then mum used to drive me to
swimming every week and like that EOS Didn’t she used to make you go
for runs? EOS That was later on, EOS when she thought I was putting on
a bit EOS Bit of a slave-driver EOS What kind of games did you play as
a kid? EOS Erm it depends where we went really, like at school there
was always bulldog and stuff,. EOS I love bulldog? EOS and football
and catch EOS pretty boring things tig what about you? EOS erm, tig,
but some people call it tag EOS yeah EOS But I call it tig. Erm
hopscotch, skipping erm British bulldog erm, rounders, hide and seek
EOS Hide and seek? EOS Yes I played hide and seek, all- EOS in a
square playground EOS it doesn’t ask what you played at school. EOS
Ooh, oh right. . EOS Erm what was the one where you had to get back to
a place? Like you were on two teams and one team had to catch you
before you got back to-. EOS Manhunt. EOS Manhunt. And that’s around
it really. EOS Ah that’s good then EOS What do you remember from your
first day at secondary school? EOS Erm-. EOS Or grammar whichever one.
EOS On the first day of grammar I was like on the verge of having a
panic attack, I was so nervous! EOS really? EOS I was feeling really
sick and like cos I’d like never been with boys before like, EOS I
hadn’t been with boys for like five years cos I went to an all girl’s
school. Erm so it was just like really weird to go into a different
environment of like a mixed school. EOS mm EOS So I was nervous. EOS
oh, it wasn’t that bad though, was it? EOS Oh and fainted EOS really?
EOS in assembly and I had to hold her up against the wall. EOS Why?
Just- EOS Erm, I don’t know it was the very first day of assembly and
like we all line up around the walls. Erm she just fainted in the
middle of it. And I was having to hold her up cos I didn’t know what
to do, it was awful. I think I cried a bit. EOS cos she was my only
friend and she’d fainted, it was awful. EOS How would you describe erm
the local people? EOS Local people? EOS Yeah, you know, like EOS Well,
from where I live it’s quite rough at the end of my road. But on my
street itself it’s quite peaceful and nice. Erm friendly, everyone
says hello to each other like, known them all our lives really. Erm
but at the other end of the road-. EOS The dark side of the road. EOS
It’s a bit different . EOS Come to the dark side! EOS No it’s scary at
the other end of the road. EOS Like when you walk past, like they
don’t look at you, they don’t like give you that little smile that
other strangers might do, it’s weird. EOS Oh right, okay, did- EOS mm
EOS did you ever go caravanning when you were a kid or camping? EOS I
used to go camping, yeah and we used to travel France. EOS oh, **inc**
EOS Erm camp- going Eurocamp with the family. But never really did
caravanning. Didn’t you? EOS Yeah we were hardcore caravanners EOS We
were! I remember the first one we went to, we went to Dorset and erm,
in the middle of the night, this dog started barking on the campsite
EOS oh no EOS and we looked out the window and there was erm- the ca-
caravan opposite was on fire cos so- EOS Are you joking? EOS No
someone had a chip pan and they had a fire and they put the wrong
blanket over and it just went, ‘.’ EOS oh no EOS Up in smoke and the
a- the awning was going crazy and the guy was out but-. EOS Did the
fire brigade come? EOS Yeah they did, obviously cos it was a fire EOS
oh, no necessarily, it could have been a small one. EOS No it was
really good one, it was a good holiday that actually, we went erm on
fossil beach. Not fossil beach it’s like a beach with all like erm
clay, EOS mm EOS sandstone walls EOS and erm it had like, what are
they called? The little snail things that they had. EOS Your fossils.
EOS yeah EOS Dinosaurs, the little- what are they called? EOS Fossils
EOS No they’re n- they’re animals I’m trying to think what they’re
actually called. Oh it doesn’t matter. EOS wossils EOS Wossils . EOS
Did you move house at all when you were younger? What memories do you
have of this? EOS Erm I did move house when I was younger cos I was
born in Salford and- but I- I think I moved when I was about two so I
don’t really remember much of it. EOS mm EOS But we had some- I
remember showing you some videos of when I was younger as a kid at .
EOS And mum used to have this- it used to have towers of pots that
stacked up on top of each other. And we used to have a chair in the-
like in the corner of the room and Dad used to push the- this old pot
thing and it used to roll round the chair. And I used to be amazed by
it and he must’ve been doing it for about half an hour, I was like,
just watching it go round and round, EOS aww EOS I was amazed.
Couldn’t get my hands on it I was just like, ‘no!’ Have you ever moved
house at all? EOS Er yeah we moved from twenty two to fourteen, just
down the road, erm, cos the new hou- for like- tw- like from twenty
two and onwards they’d already been built, and the house we moved into
was erm had been like a new build. Erm so my mum was pregnant so we
had to move into a bigger house. Erm I loved the old house I remember-
I just remember having like erm a little tea set with erm little red
love hearts on, erm and I remember had- shut up EOS I didn’t say
anything EOS We had erm- in the old house we had like, what’s it
called? Cement, and we just moved in at the very start. EOS And the
cats walked through it so we wrote EOS aww EOS and in the cement and
we had like a special personalised gate, which had on the top cos that
was my dad’s football team and erm the cat’s name, but I only just got
that back like this year from my dad cos we left it there when we
moved house. It was really good. EOS aww EOS nice, erm what th- what
things- no, what local events do you think it’s important people know
about in your town? EOS you know, the us- usual stuff that goes on,
you know like markets and stuff. EOS Erm EOS we have some erm- what
are they called, car boot sales that we used to have in like a little
town hall. EOS That was good that brought the community together. Er I
don’t really understand the question I don’t think. EOS We have the
May fair. And you get the May fair queen and my little sister was the
queen one year. EOS aww EOS And you have to wear- and there’s like
floats and stuff, that go down. EOS Oh like down and stuff? EOS Yeah.
EOS I’m sure my cousin’s **inc**. EOS What about you? EOS Erm there’s
none really round here, is there? Th- the- did the- EOS g- g- EOS oh,
there’s the s- skiing thing EOS that’s happening at the chill factor
and it’s quite a erm big place. EOS Trains . EOS Oh and yeah obviously
we have Chassen Park round the corner. EOS And erm I think it’s every
Sunday they have erm the little toy trains that go out. EOS steam
train- Steam trains EOS The steam trains and people jump on them and
they go round. And I always think with United being so close, I think
it’s good when events go on there. Because it’s big and it gets a lot
of people **inc** . EOS I don’t know what you’re talking about EOS I
don’t think that answers the question but okay. EOS Do you have to
help out around the house a lot, or not? EOS Yeah I do. . EOS You’re
made to do it though aren’t you? EOS Oh, we’re made to do it you have
to do like the mopping the sweeping, the- helping out with the
cooking, which I don’t mind cos I like that. Then we have to do the
pots every night and make our own beds, Mum doesn’t do our room any
more, unlike some. EOS My mum loves me! Feral child. EOS my mum loves
me erm, but like we all get spends for doing different chores. EOS
yeah EOS so it was good EOS I used to get spends but she stopped that
when I moved out, EOS like, ‘no you’re not having that any more.’ EOS
How about you do you do chores around the house? EOS No not really, I
think I’m quite lucky in that respect I just sit around doing nothing
EOS and Mum runs round after everybody EOS She always complains about
it though no-one ever makes her do it. She always does it herself.
It’s every Sunday, like when you’re finally- you know when you’re
coming back from half-term and you’re going back to school on the
Sunday she’s stressing out she’s like, ‘oh- oh have you got your
dinner have you got your dinner, have you got your money, have you
cleaned- have you packed your bag, have you packed your bag?’ EOS Aww.
EOS And she gets herself in like a little panic and starts like
getting mad at everybody. EOS It’s like, ‘chill out for a minute!’ EOS
where are your parents from? EOS That’s a good question EOS I don’t
know, I think they both went to erm- both from I think. Yeah Dad used
to live down near , down that way. EOS mm EOS And I don’t know where
my mum used to live. Actually my mum might’ve used to live down near
the cemetery in . And she went to school with erm dad, as well EOS ooh
EOS she was in couple of years below. EOS ooh EOS And I think they
know each other actually. EOS ooh EOS Really? EOS Yeah where are your
mum and dad from? EOS Er I think my dad’s from , I don’t- I’ve never
known him to live anywhere else. Erm and I think my da- mum’s from ,
ish maybe. EOS yeah EOS good on her, good on her, EOS all my family
are from round here though actually. Like my nanna’s from I think. I
think that’s about it, that’s how foreign I am EOS no but- EOS Aren’t
you like half or something? EOS I’m not I’m like, heritage wise like
my Grandma- well my Nanna was , EOS really? EOS my granddad was , my
other grandma was . EOS My granddad was- well is-. EOS English. EOS
He’s- well no he’s half Scottish or Irish, think it’s Scottish, which
is the one that wears kilts. EOS Scotland EOS he’s Scottish then, no
cos we have our own erm, EOS does he just- does he just walk around
wearing a kilt all the time EOS No but we have our own what’s-it-
called, what’s the material the kilt’s made out of? You know that
pattern? EOS Oh yeah. EOS Tartan. EOS Tartan we have our own tartan.
EOS mm EOS We do! EOS **inc** That’s a lie EOS no, it’s not EOS Do you
have any pets at the moment or-? EOS Er yeah I’ve got a dog called ,
full name . EOS No we’ve got and the rabbit, . EOS That just gets like
left out in the cold EOS it doesn’t EOS for no love. EOS You don’t
have any pets do you? EOS No I don’t, I don’t have any middle names or
anything, EOS oh EOS my parents ju- . EOS What’s that got to do with
anything? EOS No, no, no- no, cos like you’ve got- you got- you’ve got
pets and stuff and I just get nothing. And like I remember when I was
growing up I always wanted to have a middle name like. EOS I don’t
know why I just thought it’d be cool to have a different middle name
EOS what’s that got to do with pets? EOS Cos I don’t have- I’m not
allowed any pets and I wasn’t allowed a middle name EOS Oh my god .
EOS That’s how it goes. You’ve got some strange middle names haven’t
you? Isn’t isn’t she? EOS Yeah EOS really? EOS It’s . EOS Cos erm-.
EOS I saw it on her passport the other day I was like, EOS ‘hang on a
sec ?’ EOS She used to get so bullied for it. But not now she just
hates it, and then mine’s and is . So they’re not weird. EOS What’s
that after? EOS . EOS Oh. EOS oh EOS See mine’d be Rory EOS Yeah
thanks for that I don’t even know what my dad’s name was actually, so-
no- EOS Wouldn’t your dad’s name have been the same? And your mum’s
name be different? EOS No my dad’s, dad’s name, EOS that’s not what
you said EOS Granddad’s name. EOS mm EOS Yeah I don’t know what- I
never met them, you see EOS Okay EOS You- you got the chance to meet
them. EOS What was your school like? Did you enjoy school? EOS Which
one? Which one? EOS Primary. EOS Er it was okay, it was just- it was a
bit of a dump to be honest. EOS It was like on the corner of a road
and EOS aww EOS you get all the little scally mums coming with their
kids with big Mac meals in the morning, in MacDonald’s bags, it was
horrible. But it wasn’t too bad, I was glad to get away. All the kids
were idiots as well, y- EOS No you hear stories like all of them, like
there’s one that lives behind me and he’s er he’s nearly been kicked
out of his house a few times. He’s been in trouble with police and
stuff. And just random stuff like that. I was lucky to get away from
it EOS I think, what was yours like? EOS I- I loved it was amazing.
Erm I think it’s changed quite a lot now. But at the time it was just
really good, it had really nice people there, everyone was really
friendly. EOS mm EOS it like- the people there like were of all
different types. EOS Like some were a lot rougher than others but
when- like I didn’t really notice it at such a young age, like I was
friends with anyone and everyone. And I still would be but I didn’t
really notice it, EOS mm EOS but now when you walk past you can see
the difference between EOS yeah EOS some of the kids and it is quite
rough. EOS Yeah I just hated our school cos th- you realise as you get
older, kids just take the mick out of anything. EOS Yeah EOS Like
everything it’s unreal. I remember one day, I w- went into school with
a cold sore on my lip. EOS Urgh. EOS And I was like- yeah they’re
horrible I know, but. And this guy’s going, ‘why’ve you got spaghetti
Bolognese on you?’ EOS I’m like, ‘it’s- it’s in the morning, why would
I be having spaghetti Bolognese in the morning? And it just doesn’t
dry on my lip like that.’ EOS I used to hate it EOS aww EOS But it was
nice when everyone was obviously friendly and stuff but you don’t
realise it when you’re a kid cos you’re so naïve at how stupid people
were EOS I know EOS And how easy it is to get dragged into random
social circles and stuff. EOS mm EOS Like I think I was lucky going to
instead of . EOS yeah EOS yeah. EOS Cos you see all the different- all
the lads that went there it’s- I know they’re not- most of them are
really nice but they’re just more prone to danger not- or not danger
but trouble. EOS yeah EOS How was ? EOS , what’s the question? EOS How
was it? EOS It was good. **inc** EOS there was quite a lot of bullying
but like you kind of just got on with it, like EOS like, no matter
where you go there’s always gonna be people who bully. But at the same
time like you meet loads of good people there, and so long as you get
in the right friendship group, then it was good. EOS mm EOS I went
through about four, but EOS I think we were lucky with bullying at .
EOS yeah EOS It was always EOS yeah, it’s- EOS dead friendly and stuff
and EOS yeah EOS Seem nice. EOS You always thought the ha- they’re
rough people when they didn’t hand their homework in EOS Not hitting
teachers and stuff. ‘oh, you got a detention’ . EOS what is your best
or funniest memory from when you were young? EOS Erm I’m sure you’ve
asked me this one before, but-. EOS No what is your best memory? EOS
I’ll answer it again. EOS Not your funniest. EOS My best memory. Erm I
don’t know, not fr- I can’t remember much of my life, up until like,
after year five EOS I can’t remember anything before that really. But
erm- I- I know this is gonna make me sound sad but I remember when I
was in year five and I got picked to play for the year six football
team, and I was well happy EOS ahh EOS First person to do it through
our school, EOS ahh EOS and I was chuffed with that. I just EOS bless
EOS used to love football so, EOS what was yours? EOS Erm best memory
was probably like when we used to go camping in France, and erm, it
was just like the whole experience. Like when we were driving down,
EOS yeah EOS me and my dad u- well we all used to listen to like th-
all the old school music and I used to sit in the front with my dad,
to try and keep him- like to help him stay awake, and there was a time
whenI don’t know cos I was asleep but I’d- I’d fallen asleep EOS and
songs were still playing but I was still singing with my dad, even
though I was asleep. EOS ahh EOS And like we used to go canoeing a
lot. And then erm it was like, you were going down in your canoe. EOS
And there was a castle on one side, and you just think you’re going
straight, and the next minute you realise the castle’s gone on the
other side and it just used to feel like, proper magical. It was so
good. But the only thing was, every time we used to go, we used to
fight, with my sisters, EOS oh EOS like proper- get into proper
screaming matches, like in this canoe like EOS Just throwing each
other overboard. EOS literally we used to have so many water fights,
and not the good kind. EOS And erm-. EOS But with bad water EOS no,
but no you know like just like playful splash, but this was like,
strangle splash EOS trying to drown each other. EOS But like it kind
of just made it, like when we went a couple of years ago, like I
couldn’t wait to go canoeing again, just to see if it- if it was the
same, it was really good. EOS Did you ever get hurt when you were
fighting in the water? EOS No. We did nearly er- not drown, but get
into quite a bit of danger once, cos me and had been erm dec- we were
in a canoe by ourselves, EOS so we decided to get out, cos it was hot,
and just hold on to the canoe. But somehow we managed to lose the
canoe. EOS So we were just floating in this river going downstream.
EOS And like, there was rapids coming up. And then my dad had to like,
swim over and like drag us to the side, and then we had to catch up
with the other canoe, like later on in the stream. EOS It was pretty
dramatic, but-. EOS Rescue mission hopefully . EOS We never used to do
anything like that. I think I remember for year seven birthday, went
erm rock- abseiling with my uncle. We went tunnelling, EOS ooh EOS
that was the only thing scary. EOS I’d never do that. EOS Tunnelling?
EOS Isn’t that where you go in like, little holes? EOS Yeah it was
pretty scary. EOS No, no I couldn’t do that, claustrophobic. EOS
Although my brother- when we- when we went, came along with us and he
was- dunno how old he was, he must’ve been about eight or something,
he had his- you know those trainers you used to get with lights on,
and we- EOS oh yeah EOS he kept hitting the bottom of his shoes so
they lit up EOS for that split second. So we’d know we were okay. EOS
But other than that it was good. EOS Did you ever get her- hurt- did
you ever get hurt whilst playing when you were a kid? EOS Yeah a few
times, remember once when my dad’s- some guy my dad used to work with,
his kid came round for the day and we used to have one of those
plastic slides in the back. EOS And it used to feel so big when you
were up there, but he’s a little kid who’s younger than me, and he
pushed me over the edge EOS of the top of the slide and I broke my
collar bone. EOS oh my God EOS Did you? Didn’t know that. EOS ooh, EOS
Yeah, sorry EOS thanks EOS really? EOS Yeah EOS didn’t know that EOS
Yeah, and I was in hospital obviously, I was a crip EOS for a few
weeks EOS What do you have to do if you break your collar bone, do you
get like- ? EOS It’s just a sling, you don’t- you’re not even in a
cast, I think it’s just a arm sling. EOS aww EOS I can’t remember
though and I remember when I was learning to ride the bike, I- I- and
I can picture exactly where it is on the street as well, riding my
bike I was going along and all of a sudden I just went- like fell on
my side, EOS and I don’t know why and I hit- hit my head on the tree
and it killed EOS And I remember playing in the back and I tripped
over and I hit my side of me head on the little fence panel thing, the
concrete fence panel on the side of that. EOS Aww. EOS And my friend
got sent home. EOS it’s like, ‘I think you’d best go home now, he’s
hurt.’ He was like, ‘okay.’ I blamed it on him, so- . EOS Did you ever
used to have kids round your house when you were younger? At like
primary school, for tea? EOS Yes. My house was the house to be- EOS to
be at, it was so good like, we always used to have like- like one
night a week me and used to go for each- each other’s house for tea.
And then erm we always used to have Halloween parties. Which used to
like- I think I’d still be scared now EOS like we- we had like the
catflap that goes out to the outside of the house and my dad stuck his
hand out like with the glove on and my dad just like when people were
coming round, ‘I’ve lost my glove, if you notice it, like let me know.
And like just bring it in to the house.’ And then we put erm, nuts or
something down the side of the house, and it was all dark and we were
walking down, and my mum was like, ‘oh these are the cockroaches,
don’t worry about them.’ EOS yeah EOS And like, now it doesn’t sound
scary but like it was and then erm someone went to go grab the glove.
EOS And my dad grabbed her hand and literally I think it was , cried.
EOS It was so awful . And then we had like a hole in the table and my
dad’s head was un- like up through the hole but he had like a
something covering it, so when you went to get your piece of cake or
whatever was meant to be under there, and me Dad’d be like, ‘blar-
aargh!’ EOS with a mask on or something, it was really good. EOS So
erm- we always used to have like birthday parties and have magicians
and stuff over, it was good EOS I remember my birthdays as a kid.
Think- think the one I remember the most we had erm- erm what’s it
called now? Bouncy castle in the back garden EOS right EOS oh yeah EOS
and it absolutely hammered it down that night. EOS And the guy was sat
in his van for about three hours waiting for it to die down, he was
just like this, ‘ahh’ EOS Everyone had gone home already and he was
just there for about three hours after EOS aww EOS Waiting for the
weather to go, it was good. I used to love birth- kid’s birthday
parties. You used to get so many random toys and stuff EOS And the
party bags afterwards, EOS yeah EOS yeah, little bits of cake EOS they
were amazing. You used to always get like little whistles and stuff
and-. EOS Yeah and sweets and stuff. EOS The little ball things. EOS I
remember we used to go and for dessert we always used to get erm
vanilla and strawberry cake- no not cake erm, ice cream EOS and with
erm jelly as well, oh it was horrible but it was so good as a kid, so
much sugar at once EOS did you not have any parties like that? EOS No
EOS I remem- remember once when JJB first opened and you know they had
a little play area there? EOS Yeah EOS oh yeah. EOS And they had the-
the one half of a football pitch and someone had- er someone invited
me to their party there, said they were having it at JJB. So I was
saying to Mum, ‘oh, it’ll be a football party.’ So I had my- had my
whole football kit on, my shin pads and everything. I went there, we
were in the bloody play area, EOS I looked like I’d been padded up for
war rather than for playing tig in the play area. EOS I was running
round with my shin pads on and stuff EOS I was safety proofed. EOS Was
that, was it alphabet zoo? EOS oh, in Sale EOS The one that used to
have the big blue slide. That was like nearly- well felt vertical I
don’t know if it was. EOS Yeah. EOS Oh it was amazing and there was
erm-. EOS You had to get in those sacks didn’t you? EOS Yeah. EOS to
go in it EOS It was so good and you used to have those big like- what
are those like cylinders and you had to squeeze through the two of
them? EOS Oh yeah. EOS And then they used to have one where you used
to have to go through like four but kids used to get stuck in there,
EOS so they had to close it down, like that area. Because like ch- EOS
did they? EOS yeah kids were getting stuck in there. EOS I remember
when- EOS I was always so scared to go through them. EOS I had a
birthday party there and you used to- you always used to sit on there.
And we’ve got a video at home and I had a stiff neck. Oh my gosh! EOS
**inc** EOS no, I couldn’t move, I was at the end of the table like,
‘urgh!’ EOS trying to blow my candles out like ‘’ not moving my neck
at all EOS that’s so funny EOS But when- when they did that they- they
did erm- used to play party games up there as well. EOS mm EOS yeah
EOS And seeing myself dancing as a kid, oh my god it must’ve been so
embarrassing. Like, ‘that’s not my kid there!’ EOS And they used to
get the inflatable slide out for you as well, when we’d all finished
and stuff EOS yeah EOS Yeah so when you finished the party and went
down the slide. EOS bouncing down feeling sick going, ‘argh!’ EOS Food
coming up. I used to- I don’t think I ever went down that blue slide.
Think I was too scared. I think I might’ve b- I think I might’ve been
once. EOS I loved it. EOS It’s like a vertical drop! break my neck or
something EOS it was amazing and you went to the ball pool at the
bottom. EOS Yeah. EOS and do you remember the massive ball pool and
you could like hide underneath. EOS Yeah, and then get stood on. EOS
It was so good. Yeah EOS Oh that’s a risk you’ve got to take when
you’re playing hide and seek. EOS I used to love that I absolutely
used to love it. EOS We should go. EOS I- I miss being a- it’s closed
down EOS Aww EOS Yeah, I miss being a kid when you’re- you see some
stuff and you’re just like- and you see like your toys now and you’re
like, ‘how did I play with them for so long?’ EOS Yeah like Barbies,
like, Oh well maybe not you, but maybe like Ken or something or action
man. EOS well EOS But like literally you’d play for hours. And what do
you do with just a doll? EOS yeah EOS It’s crazy. EOS I remem- yeah-
I- I was biker mice from mars and power rangers, mine were EOS I used
to have a little power rangers doll that my cousin got from erm, I
think it was Russia. EOS And I slept with it for ages EOS and I
remember when I thought, ‘right I’m going into secondary school now’
EOS ‘I need to get rid of it.’ EOS And I remember it used to take me
about an hour to get to sleep without it. EOS aww. EOS aww EOS but it
was horrible, I know EOS bless EOS it’s not as bad as my brother
though, when he was in like year six, he went to the- the bear factory
and got a- a stuffed cat. EOS aww EOS that’s sad, mine was a power
ranger. His was a cat EOS erm describe your least favourite teacher.
EOS Least favourite teacher, oh . EOS yeah EOS Oh my god he was so
annoying he was so patronising. EOS What did he teach? EOS Chemistry,
it was- oh he used to froth at the side of the mouth and everything
EOS ooh. EOS he looks like a rat EOS Like he was really nice if you
wanted to do well but I remember in A- level chemistry, he just
annoyed me. And he was so patronising. Cos I couldn’t do it, I got
into A-level and I thought, ‘yeah I got an A at- in science in gcse.’
EOS then you go into chem.- chemistry doing A-level like going, ‘wait
a minute I don’t actually know anything about science.’ EOS I used to
absolutely hate him. What’s yours? EOS Erm I’ve always got on with all
my teachers, I was a goody two shoes but I remember in erm not erm
there was this really like chubby lady teacher that er had really
dark, curly hair. And erm she was always screaming at all the kids.
And you’d hear her like three rooms down. So you were always EOS you
were always really scared, like to speak to her. And one day I had to
go and like tell her something, I was like sent from class to go tell
her. And I was like stood behind her waiting for her to finish
talking, but she started walking backwards and she fell on top of me.
EOS And I was literally like tiny EOS when I was little and I was just
laid underneath her and this massive woman was like on top of me. But
she couldn’t get up EOS And people had to help her up and I just
thought like, ‘I could never live this down,’ EOS I wouldn’t ever
speak to her again she was so scary. Can you imagine it though, like
this massive woman like tipping over on top of you? EOS Just like a
turtle, not being able to get up EOS it’s like, ‘’. Did you ever used
to do show and tell at school, like EOS Er yeah we always used to. Erm
I don’t remember what I brought, I used to love it though. EOS I think
I w- in year six I remember bringing in my hamster EOS **inc** EOS
but, no I used to- and it was so strange cos everyone picked like-
brought in these interesting animals, and I brought in a bloody
hamster EOS aww EOS aww EOS The only interesting story was it tried to
escape once EOS The most boring pet life ever EOS aww EOS You were
only ever allowed that, weren’t you? You’ve not had anything else, pet
wise? EOS I’ve had a couple of goldfish from school fairs and stuff
EOS Nice! EOS I used to love our school fairs. They were really good.
EOS were they? EOS You used to have your little, erm, your sponge to
throw at your teachers and stuff. EOS yeah EOS did you? EOS Yeah did
you not have that? EOS no. EOS Oh you were from , they were probably
throwing rocks at teachers EOS Yeah but when you were a kid, no-one
could hit the teachers so it was a pretty safe bet of doing it, wasn’t
it? EOS sure EOS And sports day as well. EOS I loved sports day. EOS
and I remember the sports day that we had in , we used to have osprey,
eagle, hawk and kestrel little team- teams that you were in. EOS How
do you remember? EOS It was four birds it’s not hard EOS Well it
could’ve been pigeon or something EOS Why do you want pigeon as a team
it’s just EOS ‘I’ll go pigeon’ EOS No it’s like lots of different
types of birds, it’s kind of good to remember EOS Yeah it was it was
really fun though. EOS Did you ever used to have that erm- like the
two different buckets, one was filled with water and one wasn’t and
you used to have like containers with holes in EOS yeah EOS and you
had to like fill it up and run really quick, and fill it up cos it was
like leaking, and it was your team that erm- sorry and your team had
to get like the most water in the bucket, like the quickest or
something. EOS We were never that equipped as a school EOS Our school
was so bad it was unreal. EOS Really? EOS **inc**- EOS Did you ever
get into trouble for something at school? EOS Not rea- no EOS Were you
ever blamed- were you ever blamed for something that wasn’t your
fault? EOS Er I never really got into trouble in primary school, I
used to be like really good. And th- there’s a picture in the
reception, I’m not su- sure if it’s still there. And someone took a
picture of our class when we were in year one and everyone else was
like- like talking and laughing. And one of them- I remember one of
the guys, he was round the camera like doing tongue out like that at
the camera, EOS and I was there in the- EOS in the corner with my lip,
my finger against my lip and I was just like, EOS I used to sit like
that. I must’ve sat like that for about four years just like, ‘yes’
EOS proper goody two shows EOS I used to be scared of getting in
trouble I think. EOS aww EOS But I remember in year six when we had
erm, after the eleven plus and we got pay back time. And we got to do
like fun stuff outside. EOS mm EOS oh yeah EOS And didn’t do any
lessons. I remember we were- me and three other lads were talking, we
had to go and sit outside and do a bloody reading assessment. It was
so annoying and everyone else was sewing, as g- as sad as that sounds
EOS did you ever used to- we had to make these- our own little erm
pencil cases. EOS mm EOS And do the little sewing patterns on it, it
was really good. EOS well done EOS Thanks, I used to hate getting in
trouble though. EOS I remember when I got my first detention at . I
forged the signature- like the signature so me mum wouldn’t find out.
EOS I used to hate it. EOS What was your detention for? EOS Erm having
a naked pen in foundation studies. EOS You know the one that you’d
turn it round and the- the bikini costume comes off? EOS It was - it
was br- brother’s and he’d robbed it and brought it in. And me, and
used to sit in a three. EOS How old were you? EOS We were in year
seven, so like twelve EOS brought it in and me and were just like,
‘aargh!’ EOS staring at this pen. EOS And the teacher came up and was
like, ‘what’s that?’ And we were like, ‘nothing nothing!’ EOS And we
all had to stay- we had a a half an hour detention at dinner EOS aww
EOS Oh that’s awful. EOS It was EOS that’s so funny EOS I felt like a
badass after that though EOS Going round like nothing could touch me,
it was just, ‘I’ve got a detention, so what?’. Did you get in trouble?
EOS Er no cos like I said I was always a goody two shoes so when- EOS
Even at secondary school? EOS Even at secondary school. Ev- everyone
got like- you know like you used to get class detentions, for
everybody speaking? They always used to like pull me up at the end and
say, ‘don’t bother coming back for the detention at the end of the
day.’ I was like, ‘yes!’ EOS Bet everyone hated you EOS they did EOS
‘Get lost’ EOS ‘why isn’t Veronica here?’ and I was like, ‘well, I’m
good’ EOS and then er at primary school, whenever anyone used to get
in trouble and like need an alibi, erm, they always used to come to me
and say, ‘tell them that I didn’t do this,’ EOS ‘tell them I was
somewhere else.’ And I would be like- cos I was always cool with the
boys EOS and erm, there was this guy called and like you know like at
primary school you weren’t allowed to swear or anything? EOS And erm
he called a dinner lady something like a rude word EOS and- or like
threw rocks at her or something like that EOS And erm he came up to me
and he was like, ‘Veronica I’m going to get expelled you have to like,
lie for me.’ And I was like, ‘oh no but you’re a boy so okay.’ EOS And
I was like, ‘no he was here with me we were reading.’ And then like,
they completely believed me and then the teacher- well the dinner lady
got in trouble. EOS Got sacked yeah lying EOS she did for ma- for
making like allegations, but she was a horrible dinner lady anyway.
That was like the worst thing I ever did. EOS I remember our dinner
ladies we used to- there always used to be like the ty- the
stereotypical nasty one that they were always scared of EOS and then
there was a nice one as well that didn’t care EOS aww EOS just like-
oh and we used to have our wet day books. When it was raining outside
and we had to draw pictures inside it. EOS Really? EOS They were like
the most boring EOS lunchtimes of my life, cos we used to have- EOS I
loved drawing. EOS We used to have our- I think it was- we had an hour
and I think it got split into like when you were in year three and up,
you could- as soon as you’d finished you could go out. EOS And have
your dinner but when you were in like reception to year two you had to
wait ‘til half past EOS aww EOS before you could go out. And we used
to have to just draw in these books and it was so boring. It was
unreal EOS There’s only so many times I can draw stick men EOS or play
noughts and crosses with myself EOS With yourself? EOS yeah EOS erm,
can you remember a good story that your parents slash grandparents
used to tell you? EOS Not so much no. I don’t- no, er my granddad died
when I was younger EOS aww EOS so- I- like I said I can’t remember
anything from when I was younger anyway, so EOS And my nanna- she
doesn’t know what day it is, so EOS ooh EOS so not really, no. EOS
Aww. EOS There’s some interesting ones that you listen to when you’re
growing up but- nothing like major. EOS That sticks, yeah. EOS Yeah,
have you? EOS Not really interesting or good, it’s just-. EOS Do you-
do you remember when your granddad made everyone believe that he got
shot in the war? EOS That was what I was gonna say EOS oh right. EOS
why? EOS well, my n- like when they were in the war like my grandma
and granddad like, they were ov- over in Germany. EOS yeah EOS And er
my nanna actually did get shot and erm- a bomb exploded and the
shrapnel like went all in her skin and stuff. But she was okay,
survived, rah, rah, rah, but my granddad had a massive hole in his
neck and he told us all that erm, he’d been shot in the neck in the
war. EOS Erm told my mum, mum believed it for fifteen, twenty odd
years. However long it was and we believed it up un- like, up until a
couple of years ago. And he it just came out one day, saying like he
didn’t really get shot and had an operation. EOS I was like, ‘how can
you tell us our entire lives that you’d got shot and made us think
like you’re some hero,’ EOS yeah EOS and he just wasn’t. EOS He just
had like some an removed or something for whatever reason it was. EOS
You was gullible though EOS No but you should’ve- you’ve seen the
hole. Like- it’s like a good thumb like in to his neck. It’s weird.
EOS do you not think he would have died? EOS I- I- When you think
about it now, EOS but like you wouldn’t really doubt it if you’d been
told-. EOS Did your dad know that it wasn’t real? EOS Er I don’t know,
maybe. EOS My- my parents never used to play tr- tricks on me. I just
used to cry if they did . EOS You’re such a baby. EOS Stroppy kid EOS
I remember when we used to go to Macro and erm they used to have the
erm escalators that were flat. EOS mm EOS And obviously-. EOS Oh I
love those. EOS I remember- I never used to remember going erm, to the
airports when I was a kid and I u- I just used to run up and down and
up these escalators cos they were flat I was like, ‘yay!’ EOS But now
you see them at asda and they’re just annoying EOS Especially when
they say, ‘you’re approaching the landing Please take care!’ EOS ‘take
care!’ EOS yeah EOS Where else have you been on holiday then, is it
just France and stuff, or-. EOS When we were little we’ve been to-
used to travel France like I said, and er we’ve been to lots of
different places in Greece, erm America a couple of times, erm trying
to think. EOS I’d love to go to America. EOS It’s amazing the food’s
amazing, really EOS Why cos there’s just loads of it? EOS Yeah EOS mm,
yeah EOS pretty much! Like at breakfast you’d have like the proper
American pancakes, scrambled eggs, bit of crispy bacon, syrup, and
like you think , ‘how disgusting does that sound?’ It’s not. EOS They
must put something in there just to make you think it’s nice EOS but
it’s really nice and the burgers. Like when me and mum used to go when
we- when I was younger, to visit her brother, erm we just used to have
to share a meal because EOS yeah EOS I couldn’t physically eat one and
it was a waste of money and mum would never eat it all so we always
used to have to share, but erm EOS super large portion. EOS We used to
go to this place called er the Crab Bucket, or something, and you used
to just get like a massive bucket of unlimited crab claws. EOS oh God
EOS And that was amazing. EOS Oh it sounds it yeah EOS It was really
nice. EOS Was it like our KFC? EOS They have crab claws we’ve got
Kentucky fried chicken EOS No it was really good, what about you? EOS
Erm when I was younger I used to go to Majorca a couple of times but
then we gave up on that side of things EOS And got the caravan EOS And
then we used to go to Dorset and Cornwall and remember the trips to
Cornwall, were over like thirteen hours, just stuck in traffic
constantly EOS mm EOS Really? EOS That’s when dad decided to invest in
some erm DVD players for the back seats EOS so we wouldn’t get too
bored. EOS aww EOS Then he used to shout at us telling us to ‘turn it
down, it’s distracting him while his driving’ EOS And the classic, ‘if
you don’t shut up I’ll turn round!’ EOS Fifteen hours in. EOS and
then- and then later on we’ve ventured to France and that’s when I got
too tall for the caravan and got kicked outside into a tent. EOS Oh no
EOS On my own. That was the last straw I think I was like, ‘I’m not
going back.’ And then later on we went to- back to Spain I think, for
the last- Oh we went to as well in Lanzarote. EOS mm EOS Like a sports
complex. EOS Could not have a hot summer holiday like that though. EOS
No it wasn’t a summer holiday it was in April though, was in like
April, March for Easter holiday. EOS Yeah but th- wasn’t that your
main holiday? EOS No I don’t think so. EOS I’m sure it was EOS
Probably went caravanning after it. EOS Caravans. EOS No I used to be
sca- I used to hate like flying though. EOS mm EOS Cos like- like when
you’re going up and it like drops that bit, EOS yeah EOS when it’s
going up. EOS I love it. EOS Man it makes me stomach turn upside down.
Me mum’s always like ‘oh!’ the on- EOS the only one on the plane
that’s screaming EOS aww EOS I went round my auntie and uncle when
they took erm her daughter- their daughter and her husband and they
were filming her when my auntie, when she was taking off. EOS Oh my
god she looked like she was having a panic attack, like, white knuckle
ride gripping onto the- onto the side EOS ‘no’ EOS Just like head
straight back into the seat and it was like, ‘please don’t take off,
please don’t take off!’ it was so funny but it’s just weird it runs in
the family stuff like that. Like I won’t- I won’t go on
rollercoasters. EOS mm EOS That’s cos of your mum. EOS Unless- unless
there’s peer pressure on me EOS l- if- peer pressure’s the worst
thing, like when we went camping, I wouldn’t have gone into the lake
if no-one else did. EOS Really? EOS Mm, it was freezing . EOS Yeah, I
was really tempted to go in but I didn’t get enough peer pressure. EOS
I get- I- I always get scared of like erm when I’m swimming in the
sea, even when- EOS crabs? EOS no when it’s quite deep, like- I dunno
I just like picture getting dragged down by something EOS yeah, mm EOS
Like a shark or something. EOS Yeah. Even though I know it wouldn’t
happen. EOS I don’t like being out of my depths in the sea. EOS But I
don’t know why, it’s scary, when I can’t see the bottom it’s- EOS yeah
EOS freaks me out. EOS yeah EOS Like I used to be scared when we used
to go on the ferries to France, like if it crashed, and I was always
thinking, ‘well you’d die wouldn’t you? You wouldn’t be able to get
out.’ EOS aww EOS I was scared. EOS very negative. EOS It is. EOS It’s
me mum that EOS yeah EOS aww EOS And like if you go to like Greece or
somewhere, like the- the sea’s proper crystal clear, and you can see
everything. So it’s no too bad, c- EOS yeah EOS I remember when we
went to Bulgaria with the lads, the sea there was horrible. Like it
was really hot EOS mm EOS but it was just filled with jellyfish and
rubbish and- EOS eurgh EOS eurgh EOS you couldn’t really go in it. EOS
couldn’t you? EOS And it was all dirty and it was horrible. EOS mm EOS
So not a big fan of seas. Well I am but-. EOS ni- only nice ones. EOS
yeah EOS If it- yeah. EOS I don’t think I’d ever go in seas here, like
they must be so cold. EOS mm EOS Yeah the amount of just rubbish
that’s in it, it’s horrible. EOS eurgh sewage. EOS Y- you see little
scraggy kids just weeing in it don’t you EOS That is their toilet in
Blackpool it’s- it’s- EOS ‘do you need the toilet?’ EOS No, but like
everyone used to pee in the pool when they were a kid and stuff and
like-. EOS I didn’t. EOS Yes you did EOS First I’ve heard of it EOS I
don’t mean like ten year old kid, EOS I mean like smaller. EOS When
you were- when you were younger, I know. Just kidding, just kidding.
EOS right, erm- go on, EOS right, go on, what were you gonna say? EOS
I was gonna ask a question. EOS I was just gonna say- it doesn’t
matter, I- EOS I was just gonna carry on the conversation but ask me a
question, it’s okay. EOS I’ll answer it EOS Do you want me to ask- ask
you a question? Erm . EOS There’s- I- I w- I’m just gonna carry on
with my conversation EOS Like I hate how my mum and dad used to- well
my mum especially used to EOS ooh EOS make me scared of like, loads of
random things. Like rollercoasters and- EOS mm EOS sh- cos she was
always like, ‘don’t go near the edge you might die!’ EOS And when
you’re a kid you’re like, ‘will I?’ EOS And it kind of sticks with
you, doesn’t it, and like EOS yeah EOS yeah EOS subconsciously you
don’t realise it and then- EOS oh EOS Stupid cat EOS sorry EOS Are y-
are you not an animal lover then? EOS Oh I love animals, they just
don’t seem to love me. . EOS No er it’s completely different like, in
my family. Like- like, my mum was always scared but my dad was always
erm encouraging me. Like to go on rollercoasters and EOS mm EOS like
proper like, ‘seek the thrill’ EOS Which I still do now. EOS like I
remember when we went to ‘Go Ape’ in- first time we went to France. I
did the first one. But I remember getting stuck on like- there’s like
a skateboard EOS aww EOS and you have to attach yourself to the top of
it. And you got to make sure your karabiners are the right way round.
And I attached one of them the wrong way. EOS And I was sliding down
and li- I got like a quarter of the way across on this skateboard EOS
that was really loose, EOS I was holding on for dear life. And I
realised I couldn’t go any further cos one of my karabiners was stuck
round the other pieces of wire, EOS and I was like, ‘no!’ Like felt
like I was gonna die up there So I had to drag myself back and unhook
myself. And I think I was scared form then on. EOS Yeah. Like I
dragged you ‘go ape’ the other- like EOS yeah EOS couple of months ago
didn’t I? EOS Yeah. EOS Was it that scary then? EOS Yeah it was pretty
scary EOS I’m not gonna lie. I’m not a big fan- EOS traumatised. EOS
I’m not a big fan of heights EOS You’re not a big fan of anything. EOS
Well I am it’s just like heights, I just dunno- I know nothing’s ever
gonna happen but I just feel like, what if a big gust of wind comes
and like just **inc** EOS You’re like, attached. EOS I know I am, but,
no like when you took me it was- it’s one of those things where you
don’t want to do it but then, when you’ve done it you’re like ‘yeah,
let’s do it again, let’s do it again, let’s do it again!’ EOS Yeah, I
love those things. EOS But when you’re up there you’re like, ‘no no
please don’t!’ EOS it’s a horrible circle. EOS It’s funny like,
watching all the like the really girly girls go around and like
getting stuck. EOS Yeah. EOS And you just think- I’m always like,
‘just hurry up!’ EOS I get really restless. EOS I- in France we met
this erm- Mum and dad met this couple, and they had two kids of a
similar age to me and and erm we went with them to go ape. And it was
the one- the time when I got stuck on the skateboard. And this guy’s
dad had to get erm abseiled down by the people cos he was scared. EOS
Why? EOS He couldn’t do it he was scared of heights. EOS How
embarrassing. EOS And his little ten year old kid did it and he was-
he was like hugging this tree, waiting for the people to climb up
and-. EOS Aww. The man or the ten year old? EOS The man. R It was kind
of like, ‘see dad? I’m not a girl.’ EOS aww EOS aww bless. EOS And he
had to wait there for like half an hour while they got all the
equipment sorted up and stuff, and get carried down. EOS aww EOS Aww I
couldn’t do that, I’d rather just finish than have the shame of s- of
another full grown man carrying-. EOS E- everyone watching you, ‘ha
ha!’ EOS Exactly cos you’re keeping everyone else like up, cos you
can’t like cross people’s paths when you’re up there. EOS yeah EOS
Hmm, I know. EOS I’d be so annoyed. I’d be like, ‘hurry up!’ EOS Cos
you’re impatient though, that’s the thing isn’t it? EOS You g- just go
to think like- I don’t think- you just gotta- it’s weird, the
connotation of when you are- as a kid. How much it stays like that.
And that’s about it really, isn’t it? EOS Yeah. EOS Right 43.50 . EOS Right when you’re ready. EOS You start off Fearne then.
EOS Well I went to school in which is called school. EOS mm, mm EOS
You know I’ve been there for a long time. A very long- I couldn’t
remember how many years but I lived there for a long time with me

out and it made you wo- EOS Yeah. EOS And then I went to . I don’t
know if you’ve ever heard of EOS mm EOS it’s a- I loved it there.
There was two ladies that’s all who taught you. I didn’t like school
with having the problem with speech. EOS mm EOS It was- you know- but
erm I went and as soon as I- I was fourteen I left. EOS Really? EOS
Yeah. EOS Mm. EOS I just didn’t like it. EOS mm EOS So did I get into
trouble? No I don’t think I did. The only t- I- yeah I got six of the
best once. EOS Mm. EOS Why? EOS Well I used to write d- I used to go
to s- erm the school that and there’s always a bully- EOS Mm. EOS Mm.
EOS and I was riding me bike back to school and he stopped me and he
made me give him a lift on my crossbar. And when I got to school- oh I
got stopped- we got stopped on the way there by a policeman. EOS mm
EOS ‘Which school do you go to?’ So I told him and the middle of the
afternoon I was in the headmaster’s office and I got six of the best.
EOS mm EOS Caned for doing that. And lookayat the world today. EOS Mm.
EOS Mm. EOS Just with having someone on- on your bike. On your
crossbar. EOS Well I left school- I think I left school when I was
six- I think I was sixteen when I left s- when I left school, I- EOS
Mm. I- I liked me childhood days yes because I was l- lucky that our
house was only about the- a couple of hundred yards off a farm. EOS mm
EOS oh, that’s nice EOS And I was always on there and I love animals.
EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. EOS And me favourite animal’s the cow. It’s so laid
back and- EOS Mm. EOS just like that the cow you know. So I spent a- a
lot of my- my time with animals on- on the farm you know. EOS Yeah,
that’s nice EOS I once- yeah I was still at school and there was a c-
c- couple of farms not- short distance. And the farmer asked me to go
to the other farm and erm excuse me. I was walking it and there’s some
ditches where all the water drains in- EOS Yeah. EOS and there was a
man on a bike acting suspicious. EOS mm EOS So I- I watched him and
then I went on and I caught a butterfly in me hand. EOS Oh EOS He
cycled up to me then and said ‘what have you got in your hand?’ I said
‘a butterfly’ He said erm, ‘let it go! You don’t know what it’s like
t- to be fastened up’. EOS mm, mm EOS So I did and erm I went to the
other farm and walking back I went to have a lookayin this ditch. And
I found erm clothes, prison clothes . It was an escaped prisoner. EOS
So I left them and I went to the police station in Urmston and they
said ‘have a lookayat will you at this bookayand see if you can find
him’. And I found him and they gave me five shillings. EOS Really? EOS
yeah EOS Oh five shillings oh. EOS S- so erm I can u- understand the
story now with the butterfly and you know EOS Yeah. EOS S- so that was
on- one of my school stories anyway and erm I suppose there’s a lot
isn’t there really. But it wasn’t bad. I enjoyed me school i- in a
way. EOS Yeah. EOS Mm. EOS And erm and I’m a great believer your
life’s mapped out EOS mm EOS because on the piece of land I live now I
lived in nineteen thirty. EOS Really? EOS But this is a modern house
now and there was an old house on there. EOS mm EOS And I didn’t know
when I bought this house exactly where I’d lived. EOS That’s funny.
EOS So I do believe y- your life in a way your pattern of life is led.
EOS Mm, mm EOS You know because I’m going to end up where I started
off you know . EOS mm EOS Mm. Have you got any more Fearne then them
that you’ve thought of? EOS Well there’s one here one at the top. W-
where are your parents from? Now that’s an **inc** question because
erm I got an old photograph at home. EOS Mm. EOS Very old photograph.
EOS Mm. EOS Erm when me mother was alive- EOS Yeah. EOS she lived w-
we moved away from up to- moved up to . She was alive then- EOS Yeah.
EOS but I didn’t knew me father at all. EOS No. EOS No. So- so I don’t
know about that one but erm I mean me uncles and all that me aunties
are you know passed away. So it’s- EOS yeah EOS Yeah, yeah, yeah. EOS
So- so it just that, erm, w- EOS Is your mother from L- Lancashire or
out of the county? EOS Erm sh- sh- she could- she could be. I mean you
know. EOS mm, you don’t really know. EOS We don’t really know. You
know you’re so young you sometimes you know. EOS mm EOS Do you know
what happened in those days? They would never tell you anything. EOS
Really? EOS Your parents. They kept s- **inc** secret. EOS mm EOS I
erm- when I was five I went to my Grandma’s funeral in . EOS Yeah. EOS
And you weren’t allowed to see anything so I- I was taken for a walk
in the village. It was a lovely village. There was a stream and it was
a beautiful village and I was only five. And all me life I had this
picture of this village and whenever I asked my parents what it was
called ‘what do you want to know for?’ And I must’ve been about
seventy and we had a motorhome then. EOS And I said to my wife ‘come
on. I’m going to find- EOS Yeah. EOS the name of this village’. I knew
where one of the ancestors lived and we went into this erm village and
they said ‘oh you’d better ask at the postoffice he’ll know’. So we
went in the postoffice, says ‘I can’t help you. I’ve only been here
two weeks’. EOS Oh EOS So he didn’t know any of the villagers. So an-
anyway in the end we did find a person of the surname that we were
looking for. So we went round to this house and as we- and I said to
me wife ‘get out and ask this lady walking down the path if they know
a ’. So she got out and this lady says ‘come on in it’s me mother’.
EOS Really? EOS mm, oh EOS Yeah. And she told me the name of the
village. So after about seventy years I went back and it still looked
the same to me. EOS Really? EOS But they had secrets they wouldn’t
tell you. EOS mm EOS mm EOS ‘W- what do you want to know for?’ And
erm- EOS Yeah, yeah, yeah EOS So I’m half Lancashire and half
Yorkshire. EOS Mm. EOS ooh EOS Mother’s from Yorkshire. Near . And me
dad’s from and he was a joiner. Erm me- m- mother w- worked in
service. EOS mm EOS What was called service in those days. She more or
less lived in the house and was responsible for the house. EOS yeah
EOS Looking after it. Cleaning it, meals, everything you know EOS mm
EOS and in those days it was called service. And she worked in then.
EOS Mm EOS Erm not much about school is there at the moment? EOS No,
no erm EOS it’s just that I’m looking at this other one here, EOS mm
EOS the local evening news stories about thi- important people know
about your- your town. EOS Well as I said before in I meant to t- I
meant to tell you this but I got two sisters which I never seen. EOS
No. EOS very long- for a very long time. EOS mm EOS I’ve got their
address and I gave it to me brother to- EOS mm EOS you know to get in
touch you know with us but I don’t know if he’s done it yet. I don’t
know. Sometimes- I usually go down to see him but he meets me so, cos
it’s a long way. EOS Right. EOS Mm. EOS c- cos he’s moved into a
bungalow now you see. He’s not- he’s never been married you know,
he’s- EOS Mm. EOS Well I’m not asking how old you are Fearne but - EOS
No. I’m not that bothered about my age. EOS Were you at school in the
war or- or af- or after? EOS I’ll be- I was born in nineteen forty one
so I’ll be- EOS Oh you missed it. Well no you were born in the war.
EOS **inc** born in the war yeah. EOS mm, mm, mm EOS So I’ve got an
old big photograph you know erm at home somewhere but erm- EOS Yeah.
EOS I remember I used to have this old three wheeled bike. Very old
three wheeled bike- EOS Mm oh yeah. Yeah. EOS A very old one you know.
In , very old. And the people w- w- when we put our house up for sale
EOS Yeah. EOS and a nice couple b- bought it. You know nice coloured
people bought it you know EOS mm, mm EOS So that’s when we moved for
my mother’s health you know. EOS Yeah mm. EOS Mm. EOS So she couldn’t
travel. She couldn’t go out at all much. EOS Yeah. EOS No. EOS No, so
EOS Well the war started didn’t it in nineteen thirty nine. EOS Yeah,
yeah so- EOS And I was at school then- EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. EOS which
overlooked the canal. EOS Oh. EOS Oh the boats that went along there
they were fabulous you know it’s- you don’t see them now. EOS No. EOS
They’ve all gone. EOS Mm. EOS Massive big boats with a- a- a tug a- at
the front to pull it. T- t- tug at the back to steady it back you
know- EOS Mm. EOS and the bridge used to swing EOS and that was good
there th- for a- w- watching that you know. EOS Mm. EOS So I- I was at
school when the war started and erm it was a queer time because all
the street signs were moved. All the lights were taken awa- no lights
were allowed to be on. EOS Mm. EOS All the cars had to have a light
with a slit in it only. EOS It was a- a weird place didn’t it. All the
names went didn’t they. EOS Mm. EOS They were taken away and- and
where I lived in there was a barrage balloon site on the corner. And
the barrage balloon was- it was f- f- filled with gas and when the
airraid came it used to go into the air to stop aircraft d- diving
down. EOS Oh, okay. EOS Because we lived a short distance from - EOS
Yeah, mm EOS which was erm industry in the war. EOS Mm. EOS And erm-
and when the wind was- if the barrage balloon went up and it was windy
the ba- the barrage balloon used to sway into our- our back garden you
know and erm yeah. EOS did it? EOS You just were frightened to death
you know and they erm and leading to was big oil drums on the side of
the road- EOS Right. EOS with a **inc** out. EOS mm EOS And the
Germans used to follow the ship c- canal from L- Liverpool- EOS Mm.
EOS when the- the moonlight was out you can be sure there’s going to
be a raid you know. EOS Mm. EOS And you used to f- f- follow the moon
No left channel EOS up the canal and if the wind was blowing to
Trafford Park they used to light these oil drums so a mass of smoke
went over the park and they couldn’t find it. EOS Oh. EOS Oh. EOS
Yeah. So erm- I think I’ve lived in the best time cos radio was still
new. T- television had been thought of but it had been put on one side
because of the war. EOS yeah EOS Buses were always on time. EOS
**inc** EOS Weren’t they Fearne ? EOS Oh yeah. EOS If you went out for
a bus- EOS It’d be there EOS it was there. EOS mm EOS And you can erm-
it was you know. Now what are the most important changes in- in a- in
your town? EOS don’t know EOS Mm. EOS Well it’s changed- we have no
cinemas left. EOS No. No we haven’t. There’s- that big one in Sale-
EOS Yeah. EOS that’s just standing there. I know- I used to go there
one time. EOS Yeah **inc** EOS But it’s just standing there doing
nothing you know. Sh- sh- it’s a shame really you know. EOS They’ve
gone because my youth I used to go to the cinema about twice a week.
EOS Yeah. EOS And when I got a little bit older, do you remember
Urmston baths? EOS Not the old one. EOS Not the old one. EOS I know
the new one. talks about- cos it used to be the didn’t it? EOS Yeah.
EOS Yeah. EOS Well the Urmston baths in the winter. They used to empty
the water out- EOS Mm. EOS put a wooden floor over it. And it was
sprung like a proper dance floor and they had dancing every Saturday
and Wednesday. EOS Really? EOS And they had a big bands. About a
fifteen piece band that came every week. EOS Ah. EOS Mm. EOS That was
fun. EOS Mm. EOS And you daren’t drink cos if you’d had a drink a girl
wouldn’t dance with you. EOS It was very strict in those days. EOS So
yeah U- Urmston’s v- very busy now. Whereas I can- one- one memory
I’ve got in the school days when the war started was me mother pushing
the pram with my sister in- EOS Mm . EOS down to Urmston a blackout c-
c- curtaining you know. Cos we had orders. We hadn’t got to sh- sh-
show any lights at all and- EOS Yeah. EOS you had to have your windows
blacked out so nobody could see and that is one of the memories I’ve
got. And then the bombs dropping round you. It was a bit of a hectic
time wasn’t it. EOS **inc** EOS **inc** anxious time. EOS **inc**
those- those days, yeah EOS You never got a night in bed- EOS Mm. EOS
Mm. EOS without you were i- in- in a- a air raid sh- shelter. EOS Yeah
that’s right they’d shelters didn’t they. Yeah. EOS No. Ours- ours was
in the house. EOS Really? EOS There was an Anderson shelter- you’ve-
have you heard of an Anderson? EOS I’m not quite sure if I have heard
of it. EOS It’s all cast- and it’s all iron metal. EOS Right. EOS With
four sides and a metal top. So if the bomb- house fell on it it
wouldn’t- you’d be safe inside there you know. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. EOS
We had a wired mesh all around it like an- animals **inc**. EOS And
that was called- and that was inside ours. The Anderson shelter. EOS
We had one outside our house. EOS Did you? EOS In our old house. EOS
yeah EOS It had like pebbles over it so it looked like it was just
part of the ground. EOS Yeah so it looked like a part of the garden.
Yeah. EOS Oh yeah. EOS I never- we couldn’t get into it cos it was all
blocked off inside. EOS Mm. EOS Oh. EOS But at least I found **inc**.
EOS Yeah, yeah. Yeah th- they were scary days weren’t they in a way
Fearne ? EOS Mm it was yeah. EOS You know cos you didn’t know what’s
going to happen. EOS I mean I was only v- I must’ve been very young-
EOS Yeah. EOS to you know. It’s erm- EOS mm EOS Well as I said I
didn’t like school. EOS Did you move house at all when you were young?
What memories do you have of this? EOS I moved house once. I moved
from where I live now to another part of where me p- parents stayed
until they p- passed away so- EOS Yes. EOS so they were there a long
time. EOS Mm. Mm. EOS I- I- I lived there ‘til I was twenty five. Cos
there was a lot going on in Urmston then. EOS Mm. EOS I went- with
being stammering I was very shy and reserved and I thought I’ve got to
do summat about this. So I went and had d- d- d- d- dancing lessons in
Urmston. EOS Really? EOS Yeah and I enjoyed it and I’ve got all my
medals for dancing . EOS mm EOS Yeah and that was a way of b- bringing
me out you know EOS **inc** EOS Yeah. Mm. And then course you were
always g- going dancing and m- we had a milk bar in Urmston. EOS Did
you- did you have a milk bar at all ? EOS If I could remember it’s-
EOS They only sold milkshakes. EOS Really? EOS Mm. S- sh- shop’s still
there now but they’ve run out of milk. It’s gone. EOS Yeah. I tell you
what I was thinking of last night. I knew what I wanted to do when I
left school and as soon as I was fourteen I was out. EOS Mm. EOS And I
wanted to be a lithographic printer. EOS Oh yeah. EOS I was always
interested in printing all- this was nineteen forty four. There was
one year left of the war. But it was ending and there were soldiers
were arriving home then. EOS mm EOS So they had to have their old jobs
back. EOS Right. EOS You c- I c- could not get a job EOS mm EOS to be
a lithographic printer. So- I’m talking a lot aren’t I. EOS No you ca-
no you carry on you carry on! EOS So there was an advert in the
newspaper. The evening news. EOS ‘Boy wanted to learn lithographic
printing’ Manchester. So I was there for eight o’clock and the job had
gone. EOS Right. EOS Oh. EOS Dear me. Anyway so they said ‘but we’ve
got a vacancy in the handwritten department’. Now don’t ask me what
that was. EOS So they- I went along with them upstairs and they showed
me. There was about nine men working there all doing handwritten
posters- EOS Oh. EOS which they did in those days. EOS Mm. EOS I mean
I can r- r- remember Urmston it was just full of posters on the walls.
Most of those were hand done. EOS mm EOS mm EOS All- o- others were
lithographic printed so I started there. And erm to cut a long story
short I did that the rest of my life for fifty years. EOS But when I
worked there got a pound a week. EOS A pound. EOS And I’ve written
this down because I’d forget it wouldn’t I EOS You came prepared . EOS
I had to go on the bus to Manchester six days a week. That cost me
fifty four d, old p- pence a week. I had to give me m- mother ninety p
oh no d, of the old money. EOS Mm. EOS I used to go to the pictures
twice a week for th- th- thirty d. Thirty pence. Thirty eight old
money and I was left with sixty six p- p- p- EOS **inc** EOS for a
week and that was a pound. EOS Pound. EOS And I used to live on it EOS
mm EOS mmhmm EOS and I think now. I think that’s now why it’s made me
appreciate- EOS Yeah. EOS mm EOS the value of money. EOS Mm. EOS And
erm if I can jump a bit further I then left there and went to work for
another firm who did, you won’t have heard of these will you- EOS No.
EOS You’ll have heard of them won’t you? EOS **inc** EOS Oh yes, yeah,
yeah. EOS Yeah, yeah. EOS **inc** EOS Yes. Mm. EOS Oh dear. EOS Well
the were the biggest circuit in England of cinemas. EOS Oh, okay. EOS
And some cinemas used to change three times a week. Monday Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday Friday Saturday and a different one on a Sunday-
EOS Right. EOS so people went. EOS Yeah. EOS And there was about- I
think there was sixty of us worked there. And we used to do abou- I- I
forget the amount but it was in hundreds. The circuit was in hundreds
of cinemas. And we used to do them all by hand every week. One week’s
holiday. A forty eight hour week and that’s where I really learnt me
job there you know my trade. EOS mm, yeah. EOS They went bankrupt. EOS
Oh no. EOS And I got oth- other jobs you know and then I always wanted
to have me own business and I started my own business in nineteen
sixty six . I found this old property and I started in business on two
weeks holiday pay that I’d got from the firm. EOS Yeah. EOS Fifteen-
thirty pound it was for two weeks. EOS Uh huh. EOS **inc** EOS Out of
that I had to pay sixteen pound to rent the shop. It was a big gamble
wasn’t it. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. EOS But I was lucky that I got the c-
custom you know. EOS Yeah. EOS Struggled and erm- but people were good
in those days c- anyway I- I managed to get- make friends with a
chappy who worked for I think it was Esso petroleum. And he- he was
responsible for ad- advertising and he used to bring me the
advertising to do you know big wooden signs. EOS Yeah EOS And so I
hadn’t erm money to buy the wood even to do them on. But there was a
wonderful sh- shop in where th- you know they used to sell wood. EOS
Mm. EOS And he said to me ‘Edmund you take it. When you get paid you
pay me’ and I thought that was lovely that. EOS Yeah. EOS You know.
And I worked on my own for t- twenty five years and enjoyed it. Erm
and I lookayback on life it’s- it’s had its bad times I’ve married
twice. EOS Yeah. EOS First time okay, you can’t have it perfect can
you. EOS Mm. EOS And then me wife- I went out with me wife once when I
was about eighteen and the problem was she was a friend of the fam- or
their- her parents were a friend of my parents and whenever she came
round I went out you know. EOS mm EOS Mm. EOS So anyway we went out
with each other once. We didn’t like each other EOS dear me. EOS We
went off an married somebody else and fifteen years later I got
divorced. D- didn’t know where was. Hadn’t the slightest where she
was. Until a friend of mine who was an insurance agent he said ‘I’ve
just knocked at a house in Stretford and this - came to the door.’ I
said ‘did she?’ He said ‘yeah’ he said erm ‘she’s got divorced and
she’s living in and she’s a bit of alright yeah Edmund ’ Left channel
resumes EOS oh dear EOS So Edmund wrote to her mother EOS And that’s
how that started all over again. EOS Really? Oh. EOS So you can see
why I believe your life’s mapped out. EOS Yeah. EOS Cos how did I meet
her again in when I was here? EOS Yeah. EOS You know. EOS And both
divorced and things. EOS Yeah this is it you know. And that- that was
fantastic that. I’ve got a boy off me first marriage and off the
second I’ve got t- two girls you know. EOS **inc** EOS One’s okay
One’s very okay, one’s lovely. EOS mm EOS And the other one sh- she
was even odd with her mother you know. EOS Mm. EOS I haven’t heard off

lunch half an hour EOS Oh dear. EOS But all that helped you. EOS Yeah.
Yeah. EOS Yeah. EOS And do you know what I ended up there doing? I was
speaker’s secretary. EOS Really? EOS Oh . EOS And yeah. Now that was a
good p- part of my life. EOS Mm. EOS Mm. EOS An- and the wife was in-
i- in the ladies section. I was invited every year to be president but
because you had to visit other clubs I’ve turned it down. But my wife
acc- c- cepted the ladies side of it. EOS Mm. EOS oh right EOS so I
used to go out for free meals with her then. EOS . EOS oh dear. EOS So
tha- that was it. Yeah but in those days Rotary was nearly consisted
of- EOS doctors, surgeons, solicitors. All local people. All the shops
in Urmston were owned b- by the actual owner. They were privately
owned. EOS Oh. EOS And they were all members of the Rotary Club. But
there’s none left now. EOS No no. EOS You’ve got the dentist. You’ve
got them all sorts of- all walks of life as a member. EOS yeah EOS
Yeah. EOS And erm but it’s gone now. You can’t walk into any shop
without its being a big c- concern. EOS Yeah. Mm. EOS I mean there’s
not a- a lot of these shops like left EOS yeah EOS where you can s- s-
see the owner. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah. EOS They’ve gone. That’s the personal
touch that’s gone. EOS Yeah. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah you’re right. EOS
Because I was- a lady I rented me shop off she said to me cos her’s
was a- next door she says ‘let me give you a bit of advice. Get a good
accountant- EOS Mm. EOS and never lose the personal touch’. EOS Yeah.
EOS And you’re always there to- EOS That’s the thing with the chain
stores isn’t it. EOS Well it is yeah. EOS They don’t have the personal
touches and- EOS It’s sad that isn’t it you know. EOS Mm. EOS And like
I said earlier on the buses were always on time. EOS Mm. EOS I mean I
had to be at work for eight o’clock . Excuse me. And if I missed the
twenty five past seven there was one at half past. EOS Yeah. EOS And
if I missed the half past there was one at twenty five to. And the
twenty five to just got me there. EOS Yeah. EOS Mm. EOS You know. But
there wasn’t as m- many p- people on the roads then- EOS Mm. EOS so
the b- buses weren’t held up. EOS Yeah. EOS Erm have you got anything
else for a- a minute? EOS Well I’m on this- what do local people like?
**inc** EOS What do the local people like? EOS Well where I- where I
live in I’ve got- I’ve got good neighbours. EOS Yeah. EOS You know.
Erm I mean at the back there’s no houses it’s just fields you know.
EOS Mm. EOS Right. EOS I do have good erm some people- EOS Well I’ve
noticed that now. EOS Yeah very ni- EOS Now I’m you know on- on my
own. EOS yeah EOS Everybody knows me. I know them. EOS bet you chat to
them all EOS And erm- and a- a lady opposite with her husband you
know. And when I go out at all in the evening which is not- I don’t
like to go out now. It’s not safe for- EOS Yeah. EOS older people to
go out and that’s one of the sad things of life which I’ll go back to
in a minute that. It’s reminded me of something. Erm I’ve got to let
this lady know I’m going out and w- when I’ll be back. EOS Yeah. EOS
Which is good. EOS Mm. EOS So she can keep an eye on you. EOS It’s to
keep an eye on me cos she knows if- if I don’t get up in the morning
something’s happened don’t they. EOS Mm. EOS You know what they used
to like Fearne ? EOS What? EOS Christmas time. Go into Manchester
looking at arcade. EOS Oh aye. EOS When it was Christmas it- had long
windows down the side of an arcade. EOS Mm. EOS The other side of the
arcade was and erm every window was decorated at Christmas with
animation and animals and moving and there was a real spirit of
Christmas. EOS Mm. EOS And people used to go down especially just to
look in the windows when it was closed. EOS Really. EOS Mm. EOS Now I
came to Urmston on Sunday and I drove th- th- through Urmston- excuse
me and nearly every window was shuttered. EOS Mm. EOS Metal shutters.
Well in my youth you could walk and look in all the shops. EOS Yeah.
EOS Yeah. EOS Enjoy yourself. Nowhere was open EOS mm EOS but today
it’s all ‘keep out’ shutters- EOS Keep it. Yeah. Keep out, yeah EOS
you know. We don’t want you and all like that and- EOS Mm. EOS No,
yeah, yeah. EOS And I saw s- something the other day that disgusted me
really. EOS House for sale sign and they’ve got to s- s- set them
alight these days. Well what do they get out of it? EOS Yeah. EOS This
is it- EOS W- w- what do you get out of damaging anything? EOS Mm.
It’s the same you know a car’s been stolen. They burn it don’t they.
EOS Yeah. EOS Many times in - EOS Mmhmm EOS they’re forced to put
these new railings up at that big school. EOS Mmhmm EOS Many time- I-
and we used to go in there and we used to look after the dogs. And
they used to take the dogs in there. EOS yeah EOS I kept them on the
lead cos they weren’t my dogs. EOS mm EOS yeah EOS And erm I used to
take you know a doggy bag with me. EOS Mm. EOS Mm. EOS Anyway you
always see- every now and again you see cars been burned. EOS Oh yeah,
yeah. EOS And I f- I feel sorry for the person. EOS The person yeah.
EOS You know. Find out one morning the car’s not there. EOS Yeah. You
can’t- I can’t understand- EOS I- I can’t understand why they can’t-
why they do this kind of thing. EOS Did you want to ask us any
questions? Are w- are w- are we running out of time? EOS Erm you’ve
got t- ten minutes. EOS Ten minutes! EOS **inc** my word. EOS My g-
my- EOS Can I just say? Erm my wife and I we- a lot of people don’t
like caravans. EOS Anyway- EOS I had one and I used to hold people up
on the road. You know. EOS Erm EOS we did about th- th- thirty years
you know. But when I- I- I retired my s- **inc** we’ll go up into a
motorhome which was as fast as a car could go. EOS Yeah. EOS And I’ve
been all over England, Scotland and Wales and our hobby when I r-
retired was adopting the old guide dogs. EOS Really? EOS Oh yeah I
**inc**. EOS Oh I loved doing that and I’ve got five dogs’ ashes in
the back garden. EOS Oh. EOS And I’m an emotional person and the first
dog we adopted w- was- the owner was blind and deaf. Yeah blind and
deaf. So he had to be with a g- guide dog but he couldn’t hear as
well. EOS God that must be difficult. EOS So that was difficult. EOS
Mm. EOS So the pers- so w- got her you know y- y- you’re interviewed
at home to see if you’re suitable. EOS Mm. EOS And w- when you get the
dog they come back in a fortnight to make sure that you’re- the dogs
are settled. EOS mm, mm EOS Yeah. EOS And we- oh we went to this dog
called Honey. And the day before we got a phone call from the guide
dogs. He says ‘I hope you don’t mind he wants to meet you’. I said ‘no
I don’t mind’ you know. And erm- so we went down and we met him. M- m-
my wife sat beside him and questions were asked and if it meant just a
yes or a- a no answer- EOS Mm. EOS my wife had to either t- t- t- tap
his hand for yes. I forget which way round or- EOS Mm. EOS rub it for
no you know. EOS Oh okay EOS And anyway the- he had a- like a- a
machine tha- a braille machine. EOS Yeah. EOS And the guide dog people
used to t- t- type the message in and he picked it up. EOS Right. EOS
So that- but he must’ve gone deaf later in life cos he could still
talk. EOS Yeah. EOS So he could talk to us, anyhow, after half an hour
he’d- he’d handed over the- the- the lead to my wife. He’d handed over
the dog’s tablets. He had his other dog there- EOS Mm. EOS but he was
handing over his eyes and his ears. EOS Aw. EOS And after half an hour
they said to me ‘Mr Jacobs will you t- t- take the dog’s lead and go’.
Well I got outside there and I thought I’ve taken his eyes and ears
away and I cried my eyes out. and they had to take me for a cup of tea
you know. EOS Aw . EOS It’s- it’s a traumatic situation- EOS Yep EOS
mm EOS taking away- EOS Yeah. I’ve- I’ve done a lot of erm- I do a lot
of charity work for- EOS Yeah. EOS for animals you know. EOS Oh okay
Yeah. EOS And I- you know you had coppers I’d save them in a carrier
bag. EOS Mm yeah. EOS Sainsbury’s carrier bag and I take them down to
erm Sale. EOS Yeah. EOS Mm. EOS the, you know, for sick animals.
That’s what I did because I love animals you know. I don’t like to see
people to be cruel you know. EOS Oh no no. EOS No. EOS Well I seen a
greyhound near- in Partington- EOS Mm. EOS I don’t know who it belongs
to but it had a- like a- one of these white collars you know. EOS Oh
yeah. Yeah. EOS I don’t know if it had escaped from a greyhound thing
or what. EOS Mm somebody owned it yeah. EOS Or- it came up to me
friendly. EOS Mm. EOS I was watching these- these lads you know.
They’re always drinking frigging beer. Wha- you know. EOS Yeah oh I
know. Yeah mm. EOS I didn- I saw this- this chap ‘go away, go a-
away’. EOS Yeah. EOS And I thought leave him alone. Poor thing’s not
doing any harm. EOS Yeah of course he’s not hurting anyone. EOS Yeah.
EOS And I took some biscuits out with me last night. EOS Mm. EOS and
he wasn’t there. EOS Wasn’t there. EOS No so I don’t know who- who
owns it. But it’s a- it’s a shame you know. EOS Mm. EOS Well, when-
when we had ordinary dogs you know pet dogs before we started to
adopt- EOS Mm. EOS Oh that’s right. We got to the end of the- I- with
the guide dogs. EOS I was saying I don’t think I can have another
because of walking them. So the vet came out with the dogs. He says
‘this dogs are l- these dogs are lovely to walk’. T- twenty minutes a
day and they spent the rest of the time by the fire. And that was a
greyhound. EOS Yeah. EOS Greyhound yeah. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. EOS So
erm anyway I- I never got round to it because me doggy died and then
me wife died. EOS Yeah. EOS And on your own you can’t look after a
dog. EOS Yeah. EOS But just going back to life. Fearne and myself go
to church. EOS Yeah. EOS Now whether that’s made us any better people
I don’t know. EOS Well it does with me because I mean I do believe.
You know. EOS Yeah. EOS I’m- I am a Christian and I do believe. EOS
Yeah mm. EOS And I do a lot for church in . EOS Yeah. EOS mm EOS And I
help out with the Sunday School as well you see- EOS Yeah. EOS Mm. EOS
with the children. The lady what’s been doing it for a- a- well her
name’s . EOS Mm. EOS She’d been doing it for a long time. She does all
the work you know and everything. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. EOS And I just
go in with her to help her you know. EOS mm EOS So- EOS Well- EOS
that’s what I’m going to do as well. EOS I enjoyed ch- church. Really
enjoyed it. Been all me life cos I was first introduced when I was
five. EOS Really? EOS With going to a church school. EOS Mm. EOS And
then a church school. And then I was in the best youth club of all
which was a church and then I moved away from the church w- when I got
married first time. Never went back. And I’ve been a very active
member involved in doing everything. EOS Yeah. EOS And enjoyed it. Now
I won’t mention any names or where I’m going but this vicar doesn’t
get the best out of me. EOS Oh really. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah, and it’s sad
that. EOS Yeah. EOS And he knows it. He’s a nice chap. Great with my
wife when she was poorly. EOS Yeah. EOS Mm. EOS I mean, he said to us
m- me daughter ‘any time night or day you want me call me’. EOS Mm.
EOS Well me wife died at home. Five o clock in the mor- morning. EOS I
was lucky that night that I had erm a nurse f- from who was with me.
EOS Yeah. EOS Cos I wouldn’t have known what to do on me own properly.
EOS Mm. EOS Mm. EOS So I rang me daughter up. She came and she said
‘I’m going to ring the vicar’. EOS Yeah. EOS And he was w- with us
within half an hour. EOS Really? Aw. EOS So he- he- he was good on
that side. EOS Yeah. EOS When you really needed him he was there and I
think being a church m- member has helped me a lot in life. EOS Mm.
EOS I- I’m very honest. I’m very sincere. I talk a lot. EOS I l- I
like to listen to you you know. I like to listen to you you know. EOS
I’ve got hundreds of stories that I can’t- I EOS But is it- an- nearly
up yet? EOS **inc** yeah. Yeah. Can you just count to three please. EOS One, two, three. EOS
Yeah. Ok that’s great. When you’re ready. EOS Ok Arnold . I’ll kick
off- we’ll kick off with you shall we? EOS What? EOS Your best or
funniest memory. EOS Best or funniest memory from when I was young.
EOS When you were young. EOS Erm- EOS Can you remember that far back?
EOS w- h- how young are we talking about here? EOS Well- EOS Very
young. EOS Again it depends really on how far back you can remember .
EOS Yeah, I think the best- probably the best memory I have of- of
being young is- is Christmas time when all the family used to get
together in those days we- we always had all our aunts and uncles and
cousins round on Christmas day and- EOS Yeah. EOS and erm- we- w-
there wasn’t an awful lot of money but erm we used to have quite a big
s- slap up meal at lunchtimes and lots of games and lots of fun. No
television of course in those days so yeah that’s probably the best
memory I’ve got from being young. EOS How young were you then? When
you did- EOS Oh from- EOS when you did change? EOS I would think that
was from being- from as early as I can remember being through- going
through to being about twelve. Something like that. EOS So your life
changed soon after you’ve met me? EOS Yeah, yeah, yeah. EOS Yeah. EOS
But erm a- as- as people grew older they didn’t want to- EOS families
got bigger as well. They did- EOS Yeah. EOS th- they didn’t get
together the same. EOS Up to that age I erm- I think my Christmases
were very similar in that people came to us for a Christmas lunch. But
because the erm, accomodation that we had at the time was a bit
cramped all the children went into the back room and the adults were
in the main dining room cos that’s when we lived at the laundry. We
had a chinese laundry in those days. EOS Really? EOS And the- the
front room was shop. EOS Yeah. EOS It was where we did the ironing,
stored the laundry that had been packaged. EOS Mm. EOS And the middle
room was the living room where we did everything . EOS And the back
room was the stove room. EOS There was a coal fired stove with flat
irons against it. But there was a big table in there as well. So
that’s where the kids sat to have their Christmas dinner. But it was
still good fun and happy times. EOS How many of you? EOS In total
people- oh- well there was- EOS Kids. EOS three six erm I- I can’t
think of it. Two sisters at the time and , myself. wasn’t with us
then. EOS Oh ok. EOS was an after thought. EOS yeah EOS I think my mum
thought she was going to get a new washing machine for Christmas you
know. She got instead. EOS Mm. EOS Erm then there’d be my three
cousins , . You’ve met haven’t you? EOS Yeah. EOS From . EOS Yeah. .
EOS And . EOS Mm. EOS And erm- EOS and there’d be my grandad. Auntie ,
mum, dad, uncle and auntie they were parents. Uncle and auntie they
were Pamela’s parents. Auntie used to come on her own because grandad
didn’t like uncle - EOS and uncle didn’t like Grandad . So he- had
the- he had Christmas dinner with his mother. EOS Aw. EOS So there was
a lot of us. EOS Mm. EOS And erm the odd friend. People like that used
to pop in throughout the day. Erm- but one of the most memorable
things as a kid happened when I was at the laundry. Erm when me
grandmother was alive she used to make beetroot wine. EOS Ok. EOS And
you had to wait for it to mature- EOS before you drank it. But I was
being a little bit eager and I opened one before it was ready and it
was like champagne and this red fizz went a- all over- EOS Ah- oh no.
EOS freshly laudered sheets, shirts, pillow cases. EOS Ha. EOS A whole
days washing was absolutely ruined. And I think I went to me bedroom,
locked it, and I was there for two day . EOS I was scared stiff of me
grandad. EOS Hm. EOS He really did rule the roost. EOS Really? EOS
Yeah. Fearsome character but erm extremely kind as well - EOS and hard
working. EOS Yeah. EOS His day used to start at about six o clock in
the morning and go on till three o’clock the following morning. EOS
Wow. EOS That was Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Thursday, Friday,
Saturday his day started at nine and finished about five. EOS Yeah.
EOS But the laundry was all done by then and it was just a question of
taking in new stuff and delivering your- or doleing out the laundered
stuff to the erm- the regular customers cos they nearly all were
regulars in those days. EOS Yeah. EOS They all had their own laundry
mark which was written on the back of their laundry in small chinese
writing EOS Mm. EOS Mm. EOS We didn’t know the names we just knew the
mark EOS Mm. EOS Yeah but that was all before I knew you wasn’t it
Arnold the erm- EOS That’s right yeah. EOS the laundry. EOS Yeah. EOS
You hardly ever went did you to the laundry? EOS No I never went to
the laundry no. We- we had erm- when I was nine year old we- we moved
into a shop. We used to have a shop in . My mother’s ran the shop. It
was erm- EOS Mm. EOS ladies and children’s wear shop. EOS Oh ok. EOS
We had a few different sidelines as well. And my mother used to work
six days a week in that. EOS Yeah. EOS Me dad was an engineer so he
went out to work where he used to help on a Saturday. EOS **inc** EOS
Yes love. EOS And erm when we were there for six years altogether and
erm one of the things I think I’ve mentioned this to Barney before
that always sticks in my mind that was on- on a Saturday because my
mother was still working in the shop- EOS Yeah. EOS I used to go to
the local chip shop for lunch and I used to get three lots of fish and
chips for half a crown in total. Now half a crown was twelve and a
half pence. So that just shows how prices have changed. EOS Yeah. EOS
But erm one of the best things about living there was the fact that we
had a double cellar and in the cellar we used to have a- a shooting
range. EOS Wow. EOS With an air rifle. EOS Erm and my dad would set up
so you could- you could- you could put targets- three targets in at
one end- EOS Yeah. EOS and th- and then shoot down this little- EOS
walled area and erm- EOS we also used to do photography as well in the
cellar. We used to d- do our own developing and printing and erm cos
we had running water in this cellar. We had a sink in the corner so-
so erm yeah good times yeah. But it- EOS Yeah we used to do some of
that didn’t we at- EOS We did that in erm- EOS in my bedroom. EOS in-
in the attic didn’t we. EOS Yeah in the attic but there was no running
water there. EOS No. EOS Mm. EOS I don’t know how we coped really. EOS
Yeah. EOS We did everything in my bedroom. EOS Right. EOS There was a
snooker table. EOS Really? EOS Yeah and we did the photography on top
of the snooker table. EOS That’s right. EOS And when we weren’t doing
the photography we were playing snooker. And somehow we managed to fit
my bed at the other end. EOS Yeah. It was a big s- a big attic. EOS
Yeah. EOS That was a big attic bedroom. And it wasn’t a small snooker
table it was a three quarter size snooker table. EOS Really? EOS Yeah.
EOS Yeah. EOS It was too big for a normal house and I gave it to erm a
youth club- EOS Mm. EOS in and erm unfortunately it closed down soon
afterwards didn’t it. EOS Oh no . EOS Mm mm. EOS And I don’t know what
happened to that table. EOS Mm. EOS Erm todays prices it was probably
worth about five, six hundred pounds. EOS Mm. EOS Wow. EOS But nobody
wanted it cos nobody had room for it. Sign of the times. EOS taken my
glasses away. I know it’s big print. EOS Are they yours? EOS Mm? It’s
alright. EOS Shall- EOS I can read just fine. EOS shall we move on to
another- EOS Yeah. EOS question? EOS Would you like some water? I’ll
just get some. EOS Do you want me to- I can get you some if you like.
EOS Will you? **inc** EOS Yeah. EOS We’ll carry on talking. EOS
Please. EOS Where are the glasses? EOS Ah. Ask she’ll know. EOS Oh ok.
EOS So- EOS Were there a lot of kids to play with when you were
growing up? EOS There was when I- when I lived in before we moved to
the shop. Erm there were quite a few kids in the street and they- EOS
Mm. EOS erm all similar aged. Erm and because it was a cul-de-sac it
had a sort of a- a- it opened out and there was a- a- a good play area
for kids but we had all the fields at the back as well. EOS And erm
yeah there were quite of- quite a number of erm both bl- boys and
girls to play with. EOS Yeah yeah. EOS Erm I was saying the age
difference probably was three or four years older than me to three or
four years younger than me. So lots of kids. EOS Yeah I was the same.
We had lots of kids when I was at junior school because in those days
most kids went to school near where they lived. EOS Yeah yeah. EOS
Nobody went to school by car. EOS No. EOS I don’t know how we managed.
Thank you. EOS Thank you. EOS You get a waitress service as well. EOS
You got some- can I have one of those mats? EOS Oh yeah. EOS Thank
you. EOS Can I just say when we went to junior school all the kids
lived near the school. EOS Yeah. EOS Nobody ever went to school in a
car. EOS Not even the teachers. EOS Really? EOS They didn’t have cars
did they. Oh I think maybe the headmaster did. EOS Maybe I think b- by
the time we went to grammar school they probably did- EOS Yeah.
Headmaster had one. EOS but I don’t remember any of the- any of the
teachers at junior school having- EOS No EOS cars at all. But at
grammar school they used to park just behind- well- well I went to
school. There’s- I did three years at school erm before I moved to
where Barney was. EOS Oh ok. EOS Erm travelling from the shop in was
about four miles to school from there and there were probably three or
four teachers had cars in those days. EOS Mm. EOS And one of the- one
of the erm- the thing that everybody envied was my cousin. He was in
the sixth form when I started. EOS And he had a motorbike and he used
to park this motorbike in the- in the little- there was a little
extension to the playground where the teachers- EOS parked their cars.
And he used to erm leave his bike there and I was the envy of the
other kids when I got a lift home with him. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. We had
a g- EOS Cause there were no crash helmets in those- you just got on
the back and went didn’t you. EOS Yeah there were always a couple of
guys at school had motorbikes and they were always the ones that had
girlfriends and erm- EOS Yeah. EOS They’d imaged themselves on James
Dean and erm- EOS Mm. EOS Tony Curtis- EOS Mm. EOS who you might’ve
heard of. EOS Yeah. EOS And they were always the rebels who left
school with no O-levels and erm- EOS **inc** EOS Yeah. EOS but lots of
girlfriends. EOS yeah. EOS Lots of reputation behind them- EOS Mm. EOS
which they c- couldn’t put on theirs CVs . EOS But at junior school
lots of kids to play with. Erm- EOS Mm. EOS Out- out playing everyday.
Erm I don’t think our parents had any fears about us going out and s-
being out. EOS No no. EOS Erm- EOS When we lived at the shop in there
was just down the lane was a park with swings and- and roundabouts
and- EOS Yeah. EOS sliding and erm we used to spend all day there
sometimes you know you- you didn’t w- h- worry about your kids being
out. EOS No. EOS Never heard of paedophiles and erm- EOS Well it was a
word that hadn’t been invented I don’t think. EOS Erm I don’t think it
had no and- EOS Erm we had one in Eccles who I now realise was a
paedophile. EOS Yeah. EOS Everyone knew him so you just avoided him.
EOS He was called . EOS Yeah. EOS and he wore a big fedora- EOS Yeah.
EOS hat. EOS Keep it anonymous. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah I’ll not tell you
his surname. EOS His surname. EOS And he wore a big long mac and great
big boots. He was straight off a Lowry. Erm and he had a most horrible
face and sometimes you could walk down towards - EOS Mm. EOS and you’d
see him on the aquaduct. You could- his image was there. So y- you now
had to decide did you wait for your mate before you went over the
bridge to go to church- EOS or did you just wait ‘til he was looking
the other way and run like hell. EOS Well that’s how we coped with
paedophilia in those days. Just avoiding EOS I know. EOS I never got
that close to him. I don’t re- EOS Oh . EOS I don’t remember what he
looked like . EOS Oh I- I go- EOS I think he was just a legend when I
went to- EOS when I got to . EOS I got too close to his brother one
day erm- there was a guy who was in our year at grammar school . Do
you remember ? EOS Yeah yeah. EOS Oh he lived near and he had a mad
brother. And if people used to hang about outside their house he’d
open the window and he used to have a jerry under the bed. EOS A wee
pot or whatever . And he used to empty it. EOS oh no. EOS So- over
whoever was standing outside his house. EOS . EOS Aye that was . EOS
Mm. EOS But we were lucky where we lived because there were lots of
fields nearby. EOS Yeah. EOS Erm didn’t exist and you were soon going
toward EOS mm EOS and round there there were lots and lots of fields
where you could just enjoy yourself and- EOS Yeah. EOS go home with
jam jars full of newts and tadpoles and erm- EOS Tha- that’s right and
there was- EOS and there was no traffic on the roads. There was- EOS
No. EOS there were very few cars so you- you- there was danger of
crossing main roads and- mm- EOS No you could go on your bike
anywhere. EOS Yeah. EOS I mean regular bike trips were- EOS Mm. EOS
places like Lymm, Pickmere. EOS Mm. EOS And if you were really fit
Chester or Southport. EOS Southport even. EOS Really? EOS Mm. EOS Mind
you I did Chester once and I was so tired when I got there. EOS not
surprised. EOS Had my- had my sandwiches bottle of pop., and I said
‘we’d better get off’ . EOS ‘If I stay much longer I’ll fall asleep
and I’ll never get home’. Ah- it seems to take forever in a car now.
EOS It does- EOS Mm. EOS It takes- it seems to take longer in a car
than it used to on the bike. EOS It’s- so does Southport. EOS I’m
sure. Used to- we always used to reckon Southport was thirty miles
but- EOS I’m sure it’s- it- it’s the road system. Must be the road
system these days it’s- it’s nearer forty- EOS Mm. EOS you know. EOS
Yeah. EOS I noticed one of the questions here says did you ever get
hurlt- hurt whilst playing when you were a kid? I remember breaking my
arm once. EOS Oh. EOS We used to have- in our garden we used to have
a- a six foot wall at the back. Drop down. And we used to swing on a
s- on a washing line- EOS out and drop into the garden. EOS Yeah. EOS
And my f- ankle got tangled up in the rope. EOS Oh no. EOS So I swung
out and my ankle stayed where it was- EOS Oh. EOS Ah. EOS and I went
down and I broke my arm. That’s erm- I’ve only had three breaks in my
life and that was the first one. **inc** EOS I’ve- I’ve never had a
break. EOS Haven’t you? EOS No. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. EOS Mind you I’ve
never played rugby and you have. EOS My only- I’ve only had one break
playing rugby and that was this erm metatarsal but erm I broke my
ankle playing soccer- EOS Oh. EOS when I was about eighteen, seventeen
perhaps. Mm. EOS Yeah the only visit I had to erm casualty as we used
to call it not accident and emergency was when I fell off a swing.
Must’ve been about nine, ten and there was a little bit of competition
going on to see who could do the most daring things on the swing. EOS
Like jump off while it was still in the air and not using your hands
and just s- sticking with it and I got to the back swing and just fell
off chin first. EOS oh no. EOS Mm. EOS Yes it was that scar. EOS Still
got a scar? EOS Oh yeah. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. EOS So I went home. Mum
took me to casualty and the nurse s- said ‘Oh well that’s one way to
lose a bit of fat isn’t it’ EOS Mm mm. EOS then she just got her
scissors out and cut the excess fat off and stitched it up. EOS
**inc** EOS Done and dusted. No local. Erm so that was swinging. Erm-
Yeah, the only other time in casualty, was erm three years ago when I
fell. Tripped over - EOS Oh aye you did yeah. EOS the dog. EOS Oh. EOS
I nearly lost me thumb and I had to have- EOS Wow. EOS they couldn’t
count the stitches. Well I couldn’t. I just got fed up of trying to
keep count. It was all round here as far as there. EOS Oh yeah. EOS I
was lucky that was around and erm she wrapped a towel around it. Put
it in the air. EOS Mm. EOS And she drove me to hospital. And it was
the first time she’d driven that car. EOS ‘I’ve never driven it
before’. But you’ll soon learn. EOS How are we doing for time ? EOS
Erm twenty one minutes. EOS Twenty- oh- EOS Gone. EOS ne- ne- EOS
**inc** EOS Shall we mo- shall we move on? EOS nearly- nearly half
term. Yes lets move on. EOS It’s all about school and we’ve t- EOS Oh
we done- EOS we’ve touched on school. EOS touch- touched on school and
erm- what have we got there scholarsh-? EOS Right. EOS Holdays? EOS No
where did you go to school it says. EOS Where did you go to school. Oh
here right. EOS That one. EOS That one EOS Mm hmm. EOS Mm hmm. EOS
Well I started at school. EOS for short. Erm was a victorian
philanthropist who did things like building hospitals and schools. EOS
Oh ok. EOS And he built one in for the erm Church of England children
who lived in . There was already a Church of England school there
attached to the church- EOS Mm. EOS called - but it was the other side
of . EOS Oh ok. EOS And very few lived on that side . EOS Most of the
kids lived on the side. And that’s probably one reason why he sited it
where he did in erm- in . EOS And I should think the bridge was
probably closed a lot more in those days as well than it is- it is
today- EOS Oh it’s very busy traffic yeah. EOS cause there was a lot
of traffic up and down- EOS Yeah. EOS the ship canal- EOS I bet it was
opened and closed every hour. EOS to the docks. EOS Mm. EOS So- EOS
Yeah. EOS There was a- always queues. EOS Yeah so- EOS I remember
queues when I first started driving every time I tried to cross
bridge. EOS Really? EOS Yeah. EOS Went there from five ‘til- five
years ‘til I was ten and then ‘til I was seventeen. Seven years there.
EOS Mm. I started at school in erm or on the border I think which was
just a- a standard state school. Quite big classes in those days
about- I think I remember there were forty eight kids in the class.
EOS Wow. EOS Erm and there were- it was quite a big school because
there were four streams A, B, C, and D in the secondary school and we
erm- EOS tended t- to have just one teacher for all the lessons. EOS
Yeah. EOS Erm and I remember that starting in the second year at
junior school and the- the teacher came in- our form teacher and
started writing on the board in real writing. And none of us had
learnt real writing before that time- EOS Really? EOS so he realised
he had to stop and teach us how to do real writing- EOS before he
could teach us anything else. EOS Gosh. EOS So that’s- that’s the- the
time we learnt it. And then in the fourth year we all took our eleven
plus t- to g- see if we could go to grammar schools. EOS Mm. EOS And
out of the school- out of the year there were twelve people passed
their eleven plus. EOS Wow. EOS And I was one of them and I went to
grammar school. EOS And erm touching on one of these questions here.
First day at- at school at school. There was an initiation ceremony
and between two sets of steps and the school there was a like erm a-
a- the- the bank went down and then there was like a- a gully which
was about three foot wide and three foot deep. Erm and probably ten
yards wide at the very most and all the first year kids were thrown
into that- EOS Oh no EOS on the first day. EOS So there were probably
fifty or sixty kids crammed into this thing. EOS And if you ever- EOS
if you tried to get out you got thrown back in- EOS bodily. EOS Was it
that- EOS And that was called a monkey run. EOS Was that an all boys
school- EOS No no no no- EOS or was it mixed? EOS that was- it was
mixed but it was segregated playgrounds of course. EOS Yeah yeah we
had that. EOS Yeah it was mixed yeah. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah. That erm- so
that was- EOS Yeah w- w- we had it like that. EOS the monkey run.
Everybody in brand new school uniforms- EOS Yeah. EOS got thrown in
the dirt you know. The first day. EOS Well I suppose ours was a
cleansing our i- initiation ceremony. You had your head put in the
toilet and the toilet flushed. EOS flushed EOS Mm. EOS I think a lot
of headmasters in those days tried to run their schools along public
school lines. EOS Mm. EOS And erm they must have knew- known these
intiation ceremonies were going on- EOS Yeah. EOS Oh yeah yeah. EOS
and it were just ‘part of school life old chap’. EOS Mm. EOS You know
. EOS Yeah. EOS Erm cos I presume you had to wear a school cap did
you? EOS We had to wear a school cap at all times on the way to
school- EOS Yeah. EOS on the way home from school, lunchtimes if you
went out. Although you weren’t generally allowed out of school unless
you were going home for lunch. EOS Yeah then you had to have written
permission for that didn’t you. EOS Yeah yeah. Well I- I once got erm
into trouble for going out of school at lunchtime. We used- we used-
we used- EOS Well I did. It was when I went out with you to the local
café . EOS Yeah. EOS **inc** EOS But this was when I was at - EOS Had
a quick pepsi and a woodbine . EOS We got- we got caned. Two of us
went out to buy a bottle of sauce to have with our school dinner. EOS
And we were on second sitting and we got caught. Called before the
headmaster and we got caned for erm going out of school at lunchtime.
EOS Oh no. EOS what kind of sauce was it? EOS OK . EOS OK . EOS . EOS
Or Daddies I’m not sure. One or the other. EOS Yeah yeah . EOS Did you
have to wear short trousers? EOS No we- we- we weren’t obliged to wear
short trousers. I wore long trousers in the first year. EOS Oh. We
were erm- EOS But no we could wear long trousers. EOS third year
before we could wear long trousers. EOS Mm. EOS In fact- EOS When I
joined school in the forth year there were still some of the lads- EOS
Yeah. EOS wearing short trousers- EOS really? EOS in the forth year
and that would’ve been what age fifteen, sixteen? EOS Fifteen,
sixteen. EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah well if the parents still thought ‘those
shorts still fit’- EOS Yeah . EOS I’m not buying you long trousers
just bec- EOS Waste of money. EOS Yeah waste of money. EOS Mm. EOS Yes
it was erm- the girls wore gym slips in the winter and dresses in the
summer. EOS Mm. EOS Which they don’t seem to do now do they. EOS No.
EOS No. EOS That’s right they- that was erm- that was the same at .
The girls had a uniform dress for the summer- EOS Yeah yeah. EOS for
the summer term. And the other two terms they had to wear gym slips up
to a certain age and then it was skirts and blouses wasn’t it after a
certain age and ties- EOS Oh yes after y- about forth year. Yeah. EOS
Yeah. White blouses. EOS Yeah I’ve- I’ve got one of those old school
photographs that’s about a yard long- EOS or two yards long. And you
can see all the different uniform styles- EOS Yeah. EOS according to
their ages on that. EOS Show that to actually- EOS Yeah. EOS It’s
quite interesting- EOS Mm. EOS cause I- I think we both- EOS Did you
have them taken in your school? EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah **inc** the long
ones. EOS Yeah. I think we’re both on that one aren’t we? EOS I think
we are yeah. EOS Is that the fifty nine one- fifty eight one? EOS
Fifty eight, fifty nine something like that yeah. EOS Fifty eight
yeah. Yeah. EOS Yeah. You’re on the back row. EOS I was showing the
other night. EOS Were you? . EOS Yeah came across it. Yeah. EOS Mm.
EOS Yes so we both remember our first days at school then. EOS Yeah.
EOS I- I- my initiation was easy because I knew some of the lads in
the second year and erm they did me a favour and erm made sure I
didn’t get too much of a ducking in the toilets . EOS Yeah. EOS They
wanted me to play football in their team as well. EOS I spent my life-
EOS I’ve- EOS school life being favoured and because I had a certain
amount of what most people thought was a little bit of talent at
football. EOS Mm. EOS And erm it was misguided. This lad, cricket I
was selected for the school cricket team. And I was still in shorts
and it was ridiculous going out to play cricket in shorts. EOS So my
mum had to take me to the co-op in Eccles to buy me some white long
trousers to play cricket. EOS And I never got a bat or a bowl. I
must’ve been a pretty good fielder . EOS Mm. We used to erm- well we
both played for the same under fifteens- EOS Oh yeah yeah. EOS
football team. was captain who we still see occassionally. EOS Mm. EOS
Mm. EOS And erm Barney was vice captain and I’d just joined the school
in the fourth year. And played in one or two games classes and they
picked me to play on the under fifteens team. EOS Right. EOS So we’ve
got a photograph of that somewhere. EOS We have. Yeah. EOS Was the
team good? EOS We played in- and then we played e- for the school team
didn’t we the following year. EOS Yeah yeah. EOS And the erm- the full
team. But we were both quite keen on erm athletics and- and sports as
well. EOS Yeah. EOS I never played cricket very much but erm- EOS I
used to join in all the erm different sports day activities. EOS Yeah
I was erm junior athletics champion. Me and , - EOS That were before
erm- EOS Before you joined wasn’t it. EOS oh yeah cos you were a year-
no it’s probably the year I joined. But you were in- you were a year
younger than me. EOS Yeah. EOS So you were still in junior school
weren’t you. EOS Well I w- I was- EOS When- EOS in the second year.
EOS Oh is- it was when you were in second year was it. EOS Yeah yeah.
EOS Oh. EOS Yeah I think to get- EOS Cause I- EOS junior you had to be
under thirteen. EOS Did you yeah. EOS Yeah. EOS Cause I came second to
in the erm middle school. EOS Mm. EOS Erm Rex Ludorum they used to
call it. EOS Yeah. EOS King of the games. EOS Mm . EOS I came- I came
second and came third. Much to his annoyance. EOS . EOS He’d been
bragging the year before- EOS that he was gonna win it. EOS Oh . EOS
what was the leading girl called? If the leading man was Rex or
Victor- Victor Ludorum wasn’t it- the erm the men or the- EOS Was it
Victor a- EOS Victor vic- EOS at . It was Rex at . EOS Was it? Erm it
was Victor at . EOS Victor at . Victor Ludorum. EOS So- EOS I don’t
know what the girl got called. EOS No I only did Latin for one year.
EOS Don’t know. Didn’t- I didn’t know any girls called Victor. EOS
Victoria. EOS Victorlia- Victoria Ludarum- Ludorum EOS Oh blimey. No
no- EOS I don’t know what’s the female- EOS that would- that would
stay- EOS what’s the female adjec- EOS that would stay no Ludorum. EOS
W- Ludorum would be the same. EOS Th- that would- that wouldn’t- that
wouldn’t be sexed. EOS You don’t change it like in French from petit
to petite. EOS No it’s- that- that Ludorum means ‘of the games’
doesn’t it? EOS Yeah. EOS Mm. EOS So it could’ve been erm- EOS Yeah
Victoria Ludorum . EOS Vict- could’ve been Victris or some- Victrix.
EOS Victrix or something like that I suppose. EOS Yeah. EOS Anyway.
EOS . EOS Hello. EOS from Mercedes Benz. EOS Erm could I give him a
ring back if you get his number? Please EOS How long? EOS Oh ab-
another half an hour at least. EOS Mm. EOS They always say ‘are you
happy with your car?’ and I think yeah . EOS Yes, music music. We did
a lot music together didn’t we. School choir- EOS Well yeah we were
in- EOS at gammar school. EOS the school choir and then- EOS School
orchestra. EOS No I wasn’t in the school orchestra. EOS Weren’t you?
EOS No. No I never went in the sc- well what did you play in the
school- EOS I played guitar but it- it was the cello part. EOS Oh yeah
it’s right. EOS Erm. EOS That was after I’d left I think. EOS Ah. EOS
It was when I was in the sixth form. EOS The teacher just put a few-
EOS Yeah. EOS notes down that normally a cellist would play. EOS Yeah.
EOS And I had to just plonk them out . EOS No. EOS But we erm- we
played at the school concert didn’t we. EOS Played at school- school
con- EOS Our school dance. EOS school dance yeah. As a group. EOS Mm.
EOS At the hop. EOS Yeah. Yeah we- EOS Did we call them dances or did
we- we didn’t call them hops or anything? EOS No no no no. It was the
school dance. Yeah- EOS Erm. EOS at erm- we were the first group ever-
EOS Yeah. EOS to play at a school dance. EOS Oh. EOS **inc** EOS That
was in nineteen fifty eight. Christmas dance. EOS Aye. And what did
you- EOS I can even remember what songs we played . EOS What you sang
. Go- w- w- what songs did you play? EOS It was erm- I sang erm Tom
Dooley and erm what was the other one. Flip side of it. What was it
called? EOS Oh. EOS Run a- rock my soul. EOS Rock my soul in the bosom
of- EOS And you sang- EOS I sang- EOS Cliff Richard’s- EOS Travelling
Light EOS Travelling Light. Mm. EOS Yeah. Erm- EOS And we’re still
practising. EOS still can’t play. But I think we did- did we just do
that one year? EOS Yeah yeah. EOS Did they ask us back? EOS Aw EOS
Well I w- well I left. EOS You left of course yeah. EOS I left that
Christmas. EOS That’s why EOS Yeah w- yeah I started work. Yeah. EOS
Yeah w- we went on to bigger- bigger and better venues after school.
EOS Mm. EOS I- Eccles town hall was our last appearance. was the first
appearance. EOS Yeah. And then he went off to university so we split
up then. EOS Oh right. EOS Yeah erm- EOS Mm. EOS and him and the lead
guitarist and the drummer they prefered to buy cars and motorbikes and
things instead of amplification. EOS Mm. EOS Erm- EOS But we didn’t-
no- not- no- EOS but we’d have- we wouldn’t have been able- w- we had
amplification of such. EOS As such- yeah. Of a sort. EOS We had
microphones sellotaped- EOS Yeah. EOS to the back of our guitars. EOS
leading into reel to reel tape recorders. EOS Wow. EOS So it was
really not loud at all EOS No EOS Mm. Oh it w- it was a treat to have
played at a venue where they had a microphone wasn’t it- EOS Oh aye
they had their own PA system. EOS because quite a few of them didn’t.
EOS Really? EOS So there were no mic- no amplification in some of
them. EOS No. EOS The school had a- a microphone didn’t they. EOS
Yeah. EOS And the erm- certainly Eccles town hall did. EOS Yeah and
Urmston baths. EOS Mm. Mm. EOS Urmston baths is- do you remember when
it was the erm circular one? EOS Is that when it was the Curzon? EOS
Opposite the Curzon. EOS Mm. I- my dad’s told me about it. EOS Yeah,
well they used to have dances there. EOS Oh ok. EOS They used to put
boards over the- the pool EOS and we played there once at Urmston and
Flixton junior football league’s presentation evening. EOS Oh ok. EOS
We sounded good with the echoes and- EOS Oh yeah yeah the echoes. EOS
the water and- EOS Mm. EOS the roof top. And it was a complete dome at
the top made out of glass and one year I think it was s- let me see
was about six or seven. It’d have been about nineteen eighty. We had
in- tremendous hale stones. Bigger than golf balls. EOS Wow. EOS And
they went right through the roof of Urmston baths. EOS Oh. EOS And of
course all the glass followed and all the tiles were damaged and- EOS
the council said it’s erm not economical to repair. So they knocked it
down. EOS Oh is that why? EOS Yeah- EOS Oh I didn’t know that. EOS and
it was a magnificent building. Th- EOS I’ve seen a picture of- mm. EOS
they had diving boards and erm nice café sauna. Did you ever go? Erm-
EOS I think I probably just went the odd time. EOS Yeah. EOS But I
used to when I was younger and we used to go from school. We were
taught to swim from school went to . EOS Yeah we went to - EOS And
erm- EOS from junior school. EOS Yeah- EOS But at grammar school there
was no swimming at all was there. EOS that was- that was quite- and .
I- I went to a few times. I lot of my youth I spent in the scouts and
the sea scouts based at from being about thirteen year old- EOS Mm.
EOS up to it was probably about twenty six when I packed it in
altogether . EOS What we used to do spend a load of time goin away
camping and- EOS Oh yeah. EOS Yeah. But erm- EOS Well my grandad
wouldn’t allow me to go in the scouts. He didn’t believe in it. EOS
Really? EOS Oh. EOS And grandad’s word was gospel. EOS Mm. EOS He said
it’s like Hitler youth. EOS Mm. EOS He thought it was an army for
kids. EOS Mm. EOS But being he wanted to be very, very English and tow
the line. So Sundays we weren’t allowed to play out. We were not
forced but highly encouraged to go to church. EOS Yeah. EOS So
eventually I joined the church choir at about the age of seven or
eight. So that meant you soon got promotion cos there weren’t many
boys in the choir. I think there were four of us. You soon got
promotion to alter boy. EOS Yeah. EOS And then after confirmation you
had to go to the early morning mass. You took it in turns at going to
eight o’clock or nine o’clock. Then you were singing at eleven o’clock
mattins. You had to go to Sunday school at two o’clock . EOS And then
six thirty evensong. EOS Busy day . EOS So busy day. So you didn’t
have- really have time to play out on a Sunday. EOS Mm. EOS Yeah erm.
EOS Well everybody went to Sunday school in those days- EOS Yeah. EOS
but it was- it was only once for me. There was no choir cos it was a
little mission church down in . EOS Ah. Well the- the- the choir was
the undoing of the church in many ways. Because we got a little bit
beyond our station. We started singing very high brow stuff like- EOS
Mm mm. EOS Handel’s Messiah and- EOS Mm. EOS we had to have erm choral
communion every first Sunday in the month. EOS And the congregation
got a bit fed up with it. EOS Oh ok. EOS Cause it wasn’t the sort of
stuff where you could join in the chorus even . EOS No no no. EOS Yeah
. EOS Yeah. EOS And the c- congregation dwindled until there were more
people in the choir than in the congregation. EOS Oh. EOS And the erm
th- the vicar wasn’t very dynamic and his wife was always a little bit
tipsy. EOS She used to come in and stagger down the aisle half way-
EOS half way through the service. EOS Mm. EOS Her hair all over the
place . EOS So they knocked it down. And erm the school still remains
school. EOS Mm. EOS You know where I mean? On one side on the- EOS No.
EOS . EOS Oh yeah. EOS Yeah the little school house there. EOS Yeah.
EOS Erm that’s up for sale. EOS Mm. EOS Well the church was the other
side wasn’t it? EOS The church has gone. EOS Yeah EOS Yeah the church
was the other side of the school. EOS Yeah. EOS That’s been flattened.
EOS Mm. EOS My sister got married there. Erm I think she was the last
one ever to get married there. Erm- EOS Who ? EOS . EOS . EOS Yeah.
EOS Mm. EOS Yeah so I was an usher at that wedding and I was a very
poor student as well. EOS Oh . EOS And I couldn’t possibly have worn
me best suit cos it didn’t look very best at all. EOS So I went to C
and A and all I could afford was one that was five pounds fifteen
shillings. EOS It looked really smart and it lasted for the wedding.
And then about a week later I was out in the rain with it and it’s
like just falling apart. EOS It was. It was glued. It wasn’t stitched.
EOS Oh no. EOS So it was an expensive suit really considering I only
wore it twice- EOS before I had to throw it away. EOS Yeah. EOS erm- caused by omission due to recording problem EOS What sorry? EOS Can
you just count to three? Is that OK? EOS One two three. EOS Yep. EOS
Well Vivienne , EOS yeah EOS we know where we went to school. No left
channel EOS We went to the same school. EOS We went to school. EOS it
was. Now did you ever get into trouble at school? Can you remember?
EOS I did get into trouble once, it was something to do with a bird.
EOS Really? EOS And someb- I think the boy that got me into trouble,
somebody called who lived on . EOS mmhmm EOS But I can’t remember
exactly how it all came about. EOS But I know wasn’t very happy. EOS
oh EOS Ah. Well I remember getting into trouble at that school and I
got the cane. EOS Oh I got the cane for it. EOS Did you? EOS Yes, yes.
EOS I was late, I’ve never been late in my life, and I still hate
being late for anything. EOS Well I’m-. EOS And I dawdled on the way
to school and suddenly I realised that the doors were locked and I
couldn’t get in. And I had to stand waiting while they did the
prayers. EOS How old were you then? EOS Erm I was in the junior
school, so possibly about eleven. Ten or eleven. And I got the- this
cane on my l- on my hand EOS who gave you that? ? EOS and it was- EOS
He was a bit handy with his cane, wasn’t he? EOS And do you know it
really hurt, it- and I was so mortified that I had to stand there in
the hall and be caned. Section omitted due to recording problem EOS
Difficult years to be a child in. EOS Yes. EOS Erm wondering from one
day to the next whether the Germans would arrive on the doorstep. EOS
Cos we had shelters didn’t we? EOS We did at school, which we had to
go into. EOS Yes. EOS And practice for air-raids. EOS yes, air raids,
mm EOS I got thumped in one of those, I remember, very, very hard in
the dark. EOS Really? EOS Somebody thumped me, we never knew who it
was. But er-. EOS Well you wouldn’t in the dark, no EOS No . EOS But I
quite enjoyed . EOS I did actually. It was a church school. EOS Yes.
EOS It was always a very good school. But as far as favourite teacher
goes erm-. Left channel resumes EOS Was there one called ? EOS Yes.
EOS I think she was a favourite. EOS Yes possibly, she came from
Irlam. EOS That’s right. EOS Mm, she did. EOS with the strap in the
corner. EOS oh EOS She used to frighten me to death. But she was a
very, very good teacher. Was her name ? EOS Right. EOS She used to
play the piano. EOS I don’t remember that name. EOS And if we didn’t
sing- she taught us ‘Jerusalem’ and if we didn’t sing it correctly, oh
my word! She was very strict. No right channel EOS right, right, I
remember . Now she was extremely strict. EOS . EOS Very strict lady.
She was a large lady and she was very, very strict, everyone was
frightened of her. EOS Well I think-. EOS As far as your first day at
school, that school- I actually, had been up in the lake district cos
I’d been evacuated erm to my aunt’s. And I do not remember really my
first day at school but I do remember at the infants. And I do
remember you and with your lovely dark black hair EOS that was cut you
know, with your fringes. I remember looking and thinking, ‘ooh what
lovely hair!’ EOS I remember my first day. Cos I was five when I went.
Right channel resumes) EOS Right. EOS And I think the teacher was
called EOS oh EOS And I can picture the classroom. EOS And our younger
than me, she cried because she wanted to come as well. So she started
as well, shortly afterwards. No right channel EOS Oh, oh right. EOS
Erm- but then our had appendicitis M did she EOS and she was rushed to
hospital. EOS Right. EOS And she missed quite a bit of schooling
because of it. EOS ooh, cos it was a big operation. EOS It was in
those days, yes. Cos they were frightened it might be peritonitis. EOS
Yes. EOS Because , my dad’s sister, she had died at fourteen EOS oh
right EOS with peritonitis. Erm and we always felt that she never
quite caught up, because she missed-. EOS So much. EOS The grounding,
you know, the basics. She’s alright now but that’s the way we felt.
Right channel resumes EOS mm, mm, summer holidays for me were again,
back in the Lake District. EOS yes, yeah EOS Erm I used to go on
**inc**. EOS We used to go on coach trips, Stratford upon Avon. EOS
Yes, yes EOS Erm I didn’t go to Scarborough. Erm, round Wales. EOS
Right. EOS Me dad used to take us to New Brighton on the bus. EOS Oh
right. EOS But that’s as far as it went in those days, cos people
didn’t go on holiday, did they really? EOS mm, no they didn’t no. Well
you couldn’t because there was no seaside to go to, because it was
mined, all the beaches. I do remember going to Blackpool once. EOS Yes
I remember Blackpool. EOS And it was all barbed wire and you weren’t
allowed on the beach to play. Erm I presume it was all mined and you
know, waiting for an invasion. EOS mm, mm EOS So beaches were just you
know-. EOS A no go area. EOS No go areas yes. Yes. EOS But having said
that, I mean- our school days- we never went short. We were never
short of food or anything like that. EOS No, it wasn’t very good at
times. EOS We made the most of what we had, erm EOS Yes and I still
hate celery. EOS I’ve never really taken to celery. EOS raw celery, I
hate, but I love it in stews. I do actually like it. EOS Do you? EOS
Yes, in stews. EOS I eat it because puts it in EOS yes EOS but I can’t
say that it’s one of me favourite things. EOS Yes, no. But I think- I
think it was very difficult for our parents to feed- I mean, there
were th- three of us, ‘til was born. EOS mm EOS had my sister, in
nineteen forty four, so- it was hard to- everything was so rationed.
EOS It was. EOS It was dreadful, you queued for everything. EOS
Everything. EOS you ate EOS And sweets, when you think nowadays the
shops are absolutely full of them. EOS Yes, yes. EOS I suppose we were
lucky that erm my aunties were still at home and they gave us their
sweet coupons. EOS Sweet coupons, yes. EOS And we used to go to . EOS
Oh yes, yes. EOS And er the main thing we had were Barley sugars. EOS
Oh gosh, really? EOS And occasionally a treat, with a crunchie. EOS mm
EOS But it was- that was all you could get in those days. EOS mm EOS
And then there was the powdered egg, EOS powdered milk EOS Oh gosh
that American powdered egg. EOS Canned coffee, ooh. EOS We w- we were
very lucky, we had erm- my grandfather wrote to a lady in America who
had been the fiancée of an uncle. EOS Who died in the first world war.
EOS mm, mm EOS And she went out and married someone else. And went out
to America and she sent us food parcels, all the way through the war.
EOS Oh that was nice, yeah. EOS She was very religious and the church
that she went to, they collected for the English people. EOS Really?
EOS And they used to send us some wonderful things over. EOS yeah EOS
Erm and it must’ve been quite expensive to get it over in those days,
EOS over in tho- yes EOS they wouldn’t be flown over. EOS No, no. EOS
It would’ve come by boat. EOS It’d take weeks! EOS The only thing I
hated was the wintergreen sweets that they sent. EOS Oh I don’t
remember those. I never had those. EOS Oh they were dreadful, they
were American, wintergreen, and the chocolate was bad as well. EOS
Urgh. EOS And I- I never liked those. EOS Well even now I don’t think
their chocolate is as nice as ours. EOS I don’t, no. EOS Because and
love Thorntons, EOS mm, mm EOS in particular you know, the erm special
toffee. And when me mum used to visit erm in Chicago. EOS mm, mm EOS
Take some decent cadburies chocolates. EOS yes, yes, yes. EOS yes not
as nice as hours. EOS But they used to send- also, they collected
clothes. EOS mm EOS Clothes that were practically new. And I
absolutely hated them. Because my mother cut them down, EOS to fit me
and they were American style sleeves. EOS yes and you felt different.
EOS And I was different at school in them. And I absolutely hated
them. EOS I don’t remember that Maureen . I don’t remember. EOS And
they were beautiful things, I’m sure. EOS Yes, yes, mm EOS But they
weren’t what I wanted. But there were no clothes. EOS I know, well-.
EOS Very difficult to get. EOS Cos I know when people got married- I
th- got married at the end of the war, and it wasn’t a white outfit,
it was sort of a two piece, EOS mm, mm EOS with a great big hat. EOS
Hats, mm. EOS She always wore a hat didn’t she? EOS mm, Well I- I
remember my mother making my eldest sister- half sister, erm, wedding
cake. That would be probably nineteen- was born in forty four, so this
would be forty five, I think. EOS mm EOS And my mum- my mother had got
all the cake mixture, black market cake mixture of course. EOS Yes,
yes EOS Erm and she made this wedding cake and she took it out of the
oven and it fell into three pieces. EOS oh no EOS oh your poor mum!
EOS And she was absolutely horrified because she’d been a cook, that
was her- what she did as a young woman, EOS mm EOS and I think she got
the almond paste and stuck it together. EOS ‘gether . EOS Where the
cracks were. And iced over it and nobody knew any different. EOS knew
EOS So that- but that stuck in my mind and yes, that’s amazing. EOS
Yes, yes. EOS Erm but I used to- I did a lot of the queuing fo- for
food. EOS But we had to do, didn’t we? EOS Yes because my mother had
obviously had my sister in nineteen forty four EOS mm EOS and I used
to go and do all the-. EOS I did the er- most of the errands. EOS Did
you do it as well Vivienne ? EOS Yes EOS mm EOS . EOS Yes. EOS Cake
shop EOS yes EOS and we used to go to on the other side of the
trinity. Erm-. EOS Mm, yes. EOS And everything you know was sort of
weighed and very precise. EOS Oh absolutely. When you watch these- I
love the history programmes EOS mm EOS and I do watch them and you
know, what went on in the war years. And they’re absolutely perfect
because you know, they are true footage. EOS I know. EOS Of what it
was like and it makes you think, ‘how did we ever survive?’ EOS Well
we did, didn’t we? EOS mm EOS We never went short. Never went short.
EOS No, we had probably just about enough but er-. EOS Yes **inc** and
yet it’s not done us any harm, has it? When you think about it. EOS
Well we’re still here at seventy four and touch our toes, Vivienne .
EOS I don’t know that I can touch my toes. EOS mm, I can. EOS Can you?
EOS Yes. Oh gosh yes. EOS Mind you I’ve never tried but I’m sure I
can’t. EOS No EOS I’m sure I can’t. Oh dear. EOS yeah, yeah, well
we’ve got our own teeth. EOS Oh I haven’t. EOS Oh sorry EOS Well I
have half, the bottom. But I had mine out at twenty six. EOS Oh did
you? EOS Because I had terrible teeth. EOS Oh right, right. EOS Look
at her laughing! EOS I know EOS Terrible teeth. EOS We’ve got our own
hair colour! EOS Oh yeah and- well-. EOS Well yes! EOS With a bit of
help EOS The hairdresser’s very helpful EOS Absolutely. Erm, yes. EOS
Erm you know and what else? Well I’ve got contact lenses. I fool
everyone cos I’ve got contact lenses. EOS Ooh no I just- I couldn’t
put those in, I couldn’t mess with my eyes. EOS Oh gosh yes, yeah EOS
I couldn’t. EOS I’ve had them about- oh I don’t know, twenty five
years, probably now. EOS Really? EOS mm, since I- I’m more-. EOS I
need my glasses for reading but I just couldn’t- EOS yes, mm EOS if I
had to wear them all the time, I’d have to wear them. Just couldn’t
put contact lenses in. does. But I couldn’t. EOS Erm, well my grandson
who’s eleven, well twelve tomorrow. He use- he has contact lenses, .
EOS Does he? EOS And what a difference it’s made to his life, and I
taught him how to do it. EOS Oh I’m sure. Really, yes. EOS Yes, and
erm I did explain it and I keep saying, you know, ‘you must wash your
hands, all the time!’ EOS Ooh hands going near your eyes. EOS You
don’t want to get infected eyes. And I spent a long time- . EOS mm,
Explaining it to him. EOS Explaining how to do it, and do you know,
he- he was brilliant. EOS mm EOS And he’s so thrilled because he
doesn’t have to wear glasses any more. EOS yes. EOS mm EOS Yes, made a
big difference to him at school. EOS Because children generally don’t
like wearing glasses. EOS They’re quite cruel aren’t they? Some of
them. EOS Oh they are yes. Yes that’s right. EOS But yes. EOS I mean
on the whole I think my school days were happy days. EOS Yes I’m sure
mine were really, yes. EOS But then after we parted company didn’t we?
EOS We did Vivienne you went to the grammar school. EOS I went to
school. EOS And I went to a technical col- commercial college. EOS mm,
yes. And I suppose I did sports at the grammar school. EOS And w- and-
yes. EOS Erm hockey, rounders, athletics. EOS Yes. EOS School choir.
But I m- that’s a bit like that now. All gone by the board. EOS No EOS
I think they just had netball at when I went there. EOS Did they? Well
they had netball but I- EOS mm EOS I think being on the short side, I
wasn’t very good at netball. EOS No, no. EOS I was better at hockey.
EOS You are better when you’re tall, yes. EOS And yet funny, my best
friend, who was taller than me, you know, . EOS Yes oh yes. EOS She
was good at the high jump. I did the long jump. She did netball, I did
hockey. We just did opposite things. EOS mm, mm, yes. EOS And I think
that’s partly to do with her being so much taller than me. EOS Taller,
yes, yes. EOS mm EOS mm EOS mm. EOS Now then. Funniest memories from
when we were young. EOS And as far as brothers and sisters of course,
I had- my father sadly lost his first wife with consumption as they
called it in those days. Er in nineteen twenty nine or stroke thirty.
Erm my sister was three. And my brother was a baby, about six months
old. EOS mm, mm EOS And my father was working, because of all the
problems with like today, jobs that are difficult. EOS Yes. EOS And of
course the twenties and thir- well the twenties was very difficult.
And he went to live in Yorkshire. And-. EOS yeah- whereabouts in
Yorkshire? EOS Well I can’t just remember now, though I’m trying very
hard to. There was a very large erm- water supply, a big erm-. EOS
Reservoir. EOS Yes and it f- I think it fed Leeds I think, up there,
but it’s beautiful up there. And they had-. EOS Is it the reservoir
that you see when you’re on the M-sixty two? Going towards-. EOS No,
no it isn’t. EOS no EOS Erm and I have photographs of my father up a
telegraph pole, cos he was electrician. EOS Oh was he? EOS Wiring it
all up. And they had houses as well, and that- my sister took me about
four or five years ago and the foundations of the houses which were
stone were still there. Just the foundations, EOS mm EOS you could see
where they were. Erm and the water authority, it hadn’t been open
actually to the public and they’d o- EOS mm EOS they’d o- they’d only
just opened this particular spot. EOS mm EOS Erm and so it was quite
you know, interesting to go. EOS Yes, yes. EOS And obviously my
father’s been dead twenty years now. Erm but-. EOS Do you know I
thought it would’ve been more than that, Maureen . EOS My father? EOS
Mm. EOS Erm, well my mother- father twen- EOS mother twenty and my
father twenty two I think. EOS Really? Mm. EOS And then what happened,
she got this consumption living there. Sadly and had to go to er a
sanatorium. And he took his two children back to Windermere where he
came from. EOS mm EOS And his mother looked after them. EOS Looked
after them, brought them up. EOS And that’s how he met my mother EOS
mm EOS there. Erm, so it was quite- really quite sad. EOS Sad yes
yeah. EOS Yeah for him erm-. EOS Well I can still picture your mother
and father, you know- big weren’t they? EOS Mm, yeah they were. Yes.
EOS Tall, and I know when I used to go shopping in Peel Green to the
butchers and your mum would be walking along, and I’d say, ‘how’s
Maureen ? Another little girl!’ EOS another little girl, Yes. EOS
Another little girl, one two three four. EOS Yes, mhmm. EOS Oh yes.
But then you see, what happened with- with grandchildren. Six
grandsons. EOS yeah EOS yes EOS And three granddaughters. EOS mm, mm
EOS And five boys, one after the other. We didn’t have any girls at
all. EOS Yes that’s right. Funny that. EOS Mm. But erm-. EOS Just I do
remember when we used to go to church and you were in the choir, like
was in the choir. EOS mm, mm EOS And used to go to , Christmas Eve,
carol singing. EOS mm, really mm. EOS And your Mum, I remember one
year in particular your mum gave us all erm hot chocolate before we
went. EOS ahh EOS Did she really Vivienne ? EOS yes one Christmas eve.
EOS Ooh you can remember things better than me. EOS Yeah, she gave us
erm hot chocolate before we all set off for church. EOS Oh really. EOS
yeah. EOS Gosh, mm EOS Happy days those, really. EOS Oh, yes, that’s-
it is, probably were, yes. EOS But you and -. EOS But you never got
much for Christmas, I certainly didn’t. There were just no toys at
all. EOS Well you couldn’t- I think. EOS in the forties EOS The one
thing I remember getting at Christmas was a very nice- and it was off
a friend of my mum and dad’s. EOS A pencil box with a- that’s erm
roller top. EOS Oh I know. Yeah. EOS But, you know, you come down
Christmas day, and your presents would be on the table. There’d be
mine, and . EOS Mm. EOS Because that was it, wasn’t it, EOS mm EOS mm
EOS and a bit of fruit? EOS mm EOS Whatever- you know. EOS That’s
right and a few nuts. You alw- I had a pillowcase, always had a
pillowcase and there was nuts in the bottom, a tangerine and an apple.
EOS mm, oh a tangerine. Yes. EOS And erm they were- I don’t know that
it was quite exciting to have those at the very bottom. EOS Mm. EOS
But I used to be so upset when there was nothing left in it at all.
EOS And wishing there were more things, but there were no books
Vivienne EOS no EOS and I never had a doll for- I never played with
dolls. EOS I- I wasn’t a doll person, I did have one and I didn’t like
it. EOS mm, well my mother-. EOS I did have a nice doll’s pram. EOS
Yes. EOS And bicycle that me granddad bought. EOS vv EOS But it wasn’t
at Christmas, it was sort of later on. EOS Yes. EOS When you could
afford it. EOS exactly. Yes, yes. EOS You know cos they worked- worked
hard. EOS Well I do remember a book that I was bought. Two books- one
was ‘The prisoner of Zenda’ and ‘Rupert of Hensor.’ EOS Oh I don’t
remember that but I remember the first one. EOS And they were hideous
books, they were far too old for me. EOS I was just thinking that. EOS
And I c- I don’t really think I ever read them really. EOS No. EOS but
there were no children’s books. But from the post office, her parents
could always find Rupert books. EOS Could they? EOS Mm, she always had
the annuals for Rupert. And I was lucky, because she used to lend them
to me. EOS Yes, yes EOS You know, and so I could read them. But I
never had any books. And my mother, desperate to get me a doll she
went to the doll’s hospital in Manchester. EOS Oh I remember the
doll’s hospital. EOS And you remember that Vivienne . EOS Mm. EOS
Bought two heads and sewed them on this- these bodies she’d made. EOS
mm EOS And I had- I always had a black doll. EOS mm EOS I absolutely
loved black dolls, EOS mm EOS mm EOS more than white dolls. Cos I just
had this attraction f- for black dolls. And she got me a black and a
white one. And I went to see my friend at the time. EOS She’s a mutual
friend, . EOS oh, okay EOS Yeah. EOS We went to school with her,
didn’t we? EOS Yes, yeah. And dropped one of my dolls EOS and the head
smashed into pieces. EOS no EOS And I was so horrified I lifted my
arms up and dropped mine. So I had no dolls. EOS none at all EOS So
both the heads had gone. EOS Oh what a shame and your mum had gone to
all that trouble. EOS mm, yes, yes. Yeah, she w- she wasn’t- wasn’t
particularly good at sewing. But erm, she went to quite a bit of
trouble to try and make up for what wasn’t there. EOS Something- What
we couldn’t have. EOS What we didn’t have, exactly. EOS Yes. EOS But
my sister arriving in forty four. Everything went to her. EOS Er the-
I- I could not remember what a banana looked like. I hadn’t ever had
one, you see, EOS mm EOS that I could remember. EOS I can’t remember
when I was little, no. Because I was three in thirty nine. So when the
bananas came, erm-. EOS Now I don’t know how many there were, whether
there was only one, but my father- it had to be that had the banana.
EOS mm EOS I remember looking at this and thinking, ‘I wonder what it
really does taste like?’ EOS really does taste like. EOS And I didn’t
find out, and I wonder why they did that in those days. EOS They
could’ve given you half each. EOS Could’ve given us half each, EOS mm
EOS yes EOS yes they could actually. Erm so everything went to . Erm
but it never affected me in any way. EOS Never bothered you, no I
mean-. EOS I was never jealous. EOS I was the first grandchild,
spoilt. And then there was and then was the first grandson. And he was
spoilt. EOS mm, mm, mm EOS But because I suppose my nanna and
granddad- granddad in particular with I was- me nanna was for me. EOS
Me mum and dad tried to make it up to . They gave her more. EOS mm,
yes, yeah. EOS Like I went to the grammar school, went to the grammar
school, so erm- made sure that went to . EOS Oh right, yes EOS And got
a city and guilds in erm-. EOS yes, catering, wasn’t it? EOS catering,
yes. EOS yes, yeah EOS And then of course, and EOS yes EOS came along
later on. EOS Yes, a lot later. EOS yes EOS But my grandparents lived
in , as you know, and my grandmother would give my half brother half a
crow, which was quite a bit of money. EOS Ooh a lot of money in those
days. EOS And I was given sixpence. EOS I never had what he had.
Because he was the son, EOS son, mm EOS you know, the grandson. And
apparently my father used to get so upset about it and so annoyed,
he’d take me home and give me half a crown. EOS mm, crown as well. EOS
ahh, **inc** EOS Yes. Just to make it up. EOS mm, cos we used to joke,
you know me mum made a lot of our clothes for and I. EOS Yes, yeah EOS
And of course we’d say- course our ’s came from Kendal Mills EOS Yes,
yeah. They were like that with sons. EOS But erm- yes, yes. EOS For
some reason and we’ve got far more equality today. EOS mm EOS And you
don’t treat your children any different at whatever age. EOS No, me
mum and dad didn’t really, erm. EOS No. EOS Erm, because er- we’ve got
a photograph of the three of us and a friend of had knitted these
fair-isle cardigans in two ply. EOS mm, gosh. EOS and I had cardigans,
had erm- I think it was a v-neck sweater. EOS mm, mm EOS And me mum
made sure that the three of us had the same. EOS Yes. Yes, quality,
mm, yeah. EOS Yes, yeah. Tried to treat us all the same. EOS mm EOS
But erm- now then, what did I help out in the house a lot? Well I had
to do. EOS yes I’m sure I did, I’m sure we had to really. EOS Yes. EOS
Didn’t we? EOS mm EOS Erm washing up was always a pain, cos nobody
wanted to dry. EOS no EOS It’s strange nobody likes drying isn’t it?
EOS No, no, nobody wanted to dry. So we used to argue, the three of
us, cos was too young. EOS mm EOS Erm and they used to- did they have
no washing up liquid Vivienne ? EOS Oh I don’t remember washing up-.
EOS It was Persil. EOS Persil, no washing up liq- EOS We used to put
washing powder in EOS really EOS and wash the pots in washing powder.
EOS I don’t remember washing up liquid. EOS No. EOS At all. EOS Oh
they didn’t have it, no, no, and my mother-. EOS But when you think no
washing up liquid, no washing machine, or things like that. EOS No- no
they boiled everything, didn’t they, in a boiler, EOS mm EOS but I do
remember my mother grating fairy soap, white blocks- sorry green
blocks of fairy soap. EOS Green blocks of fairy soap. EOS And she
would grate it into the dolly tub. EOS Yes. EOS Er with boiling water
so it melted, EOS yeah EOS an- and became- EOS so it would clean the
clothes properly. EOS mm, and then they- EOS And they always washed on
a Monday. EOS And ironed on a tuesday. EOS Yes, yes. If they got it
dry. EOS Yes, routine, routine EOS mm, was routine. And we had a
cellar, where my mother had clothes lines. EOS We had cellars. EOS And
she used to hang her clothes EOS mm EOS in the cellar to dry. And we
did have a very old coke burner down there for when the sirens went
and there was bombing. EOS Oh the sirens yes. EOS yeah and- and erm,
my grandfather had gone to the railways and he was a joiner, when he
was younger and lived in the Lake District. But he came down to live
with us and erm he went and got all these- erm, this- these pieces of
wood from the railway that- sleepers. EOS mm EOS And he propped the
whole of the ceiling of the cellar up in case we had an air-raid or a
bomb- EOS yes we had our own sort of shelter at four-two-seven. EOS
yes EOS At six-six-three you used to go down in the cellar. EOS yes
EOS But erm I remember my nan, my nanna and heard the sirens. Went
down into the cellar. came home from work to find them in the cellar.
‘What you doing in the cellar?’ ‘Well you know, the sirens went.’
They’d gone down for the all-clear, hadn’t they? EOS oh EOS and they’d
been there all morning. EOS marvellous, oh. EOS Oh dear. EOS oh EOS
Little things like that stick in your mind, don’t they? EOS Oh where
were your- where are you parents from, well mine are from the Lake
District. Both living in Windemere. Er back-to-back and never knew
each other. EOS real- EOS Because my father was four years older than
my mother. But they didn’t find out until of course they met up, after
his first wife died. EOS mm EOS And my- my mother was engaged to erm
a- a man who went out to Canada and lost all his money on the crash-
EOS Wall Street crash. EOS crash. EOS And said, ‘well I’ve got to
start again, I’ll send for you,’ EOS mm EOS and she said, ‘don’t
bother I’m not waiting.’ EOS And meanwhile her best friend who was my
father’s cousin, girl. Erm just asked her if she’d like to co- go out,
as a foursome because EOS mm EOS my father had lost his wife EOS yeah
EOS and she wanted to cheer him up and that’s how I become- EOS mm EOS
th- that’s how I ended up sitting here talking today. EOS . EOS yes
EOS If they’d never got together I wouldn’t be here. EOS Well it’s
true isn’t it? EOS yes. EOS You know. EOS Yes oh life is strange isn’t
it? Mm EOS It is, because always wanted- he did his national service
and always wanted to stay in the army. EOS Oh did he? EOS Yes he loved
it. Absolutely loved it. EOS Oh so why didn’t he? EOS Because his
mother and father said, ‘if you stay in the army, that’s it you’ve no
mother and father.’ EOS You’re joking! EOS No erm-. EOS What was the
reason? EOS Because- well they thought it was erm a reflection on them
that he wanted to be away from home. EOS Oh. EOS But they never really
got on, he got on better with his father than his mother, EOS mm EOS
but then his father would say, ‘well if you’d stayed in the forces,
you would never have met Vivienne .’ EOS mm EOS mm EOS And he said,
‘well I’m sure we would have done,’ EOS mm EOS ‘because we were meant
to be together.’ EOS mm EOS So it’s funny how things work out, isn’t
it? EOS Yes. Yes, was he an only one? EOS Oh yes. EOS Oh EOS oh yes.
EOS With a terrible mother. EOS really? EOS Really? EOS Oh she was- .
EOS Possessive? Controlling? EOS Yes and yet she was in a way
possessive, and yet she hadn’t got a lot of time for him. So I could
never weigh it all up. Nothing ever made sense. EOS mm EOS Erm and his
father was away a lot on business. You know and if he did anything
wrong, ‘wait ‘til your father comes home!’ EOS mm EOS And one
incident, he’d been smoking when he was about ten or eleven, with a
friend. Friend had a- parents had a pub and they went on the flat roof
and he was so ill. And of course his mother, ‘wait ‘til your father
comes home!’ and then when his father came home told him, ‘aren’t you
going to give him a good hiding?’ So he said, ‘he’s learnt his
lesson.’ EOS Mm. EOS mm EOS yeah EOS And he never really smoked
cigarettes again. Occasionally, EOS mmhmm EOS if lit up he’d say, ‘ooh
I just fancy one,’ and he’d have one. EOS mm EOS But he never went out
and bought a packet of cigarettes. EOS Mm, my parents didn’t smoke.
But my brother did, me half-brother did. And my half sister. EOS mm,
no me dad smoked but me mum couldn’t stand it. EOS No, no. EOS
Couldn’t stand it. I’ve never smoked. EOS No, no I haven’t. EOS has
smoked but gave it up some years ago. EOS mmhmm EOS Erm has the odd
one, more a social- EOS mm EOS doesn’t sit at home smoking. EOS mm EOS
doesn’t smoke, doesn’t smoke. EOS No. EOS Erm-. EOS mm, and actually
my parents were tee-total. EOS Were they? EOS Until my father got to
eighty and then he used to have his brandy in a morning, to keep his
heart going he used to say. EOS Well they used to say a drop of
whiskey at night is good for you. EOS Well yes, they did. Yes, yes,
but erm EOS That’s my excuse if I have one. EOS It’s good for me! EOS
Oh but erm, EOS cos you read all these things in the paper, EOS yes,
yes EOS you know and glass of red wine. EOS Well it’s beer today,
apparently. EOS I know that was in the paper the other day. EOS
Giving- yeah keeping your heart going. EOS Don’t like beer. EOS I
think I’ll do without, mm, mm EOS Don’t like beer at all. No. EOS What
are local people like? The people where I live- well they’re all very
nice really, it’s quite quiet, but it’s a- it’s such a good area, I
mean the house is up for sale, I can’t imagine why nobody buys it. EOS
mm EOS Because it’s such a super spot to be, EOS mm EOS you’ve got the
railway, you’ve got-. EOS mm, everything’s to hand isn’t it, yes EOS
Everything’s at hand, you’ve got sports centres, you’ve got swimming
pools, golf courses. EOS mm EOS You can get into Manchester so
quickly, and you can get onto the M- sixty- sixty two, sixty-one,
fifty six, in ten minutes. EOS mm, I think you’re better placed than I
am, in Irlam, EOS yes EOS because the buses are about- they’re
supposed to be every ten minutes but they’re not EOS mm EOS and
there’s only really one into Manchester. EOS mm EOS And there’s
another one that goes through Manchester into the Trafford centre, or
the Trafford centre into Manchester. And they’re about the only two.
EOS Yes and the- the thing about the Trafford centre is- it- I didn’t
like it when it was first built, EOS mm EOS I thought it would kill
off all the sho- local shops, which it did. EOS mm EOS But I do enjoy
going and I go at least twice a week. EOS mm EOS And I don’t
particularly buy erm, but I c- EOS if I want to, everything’s there.
EOS You can, yeah, yeah EOS I’ll just go because it’s very nice inside
and you can have a nice coffee and a cake on a morning. EOS In John
Lewis, yes, mm EOS Yes. And er- and I do quite enjoy going and it’s
just so quick to get there and to park and-. EOS It is, it’s no
problem. EOS It’s just no problem, so that’s a great advantage to this
area to me. EOS mm EOS yes EOS I’ve never been into Manchester for
years and I don’t think I ever will really. I’ve got- There’s nothing
there for me. EOS Well I go into Manchester erm, normally every
Thursday to meet two friends I used to work with many years ago at
ICI. EOS Oh right. Yes, yes EOS And then I meet another friend every
other week on a Wednesday, EOS mm, right EOS that I used to work with
at ICI. EOS mmhmm EOS So but normally I park in Marks and Spencers and
then on a Thursday have lunch in Marks, just a sandwich. One friend
moans the whole of the time EOS mm, mm EOS about the quality and the
standard and the noise, cos it is noisy in Marks and Spencers. EOS mm
EOS Oh right. EOS Now if that particular friend doesn’t come, er and I
will go to , EOS mm EOS which is erm an Austrian patisserie. EOS ooh
EOS Ooh you should see the cakes! EOS Mm, very nice. EOS Oh lovely.
Erm then when I go with we go to the . Where you can have a three
course lunch for six pounds fifty. EOS ahh EOS That’s good. EOS Yeah.
EOS mm EOS And I might walk through the Arndale centre EOS mm EOS erm,
couple of times recently I have had a bit of a walk round the Arndale
but I’ve been looking for specific shops. EOS mm EOS And there
everything seems that little bit bigger EOS mm EOS than in the
Trafford centre. EOS Trafford centre, yes. EOS And on Sunday, and I
and we’d taken back to w- erm the station, erm we went into EOS the
Arndale and I think- I can’t remember what we were looking for. But I
was surprised, it was a Sunday and I was able to park in Marks and
Spencers car park. EOS Oh right. EOS It’s not cheap, parking in- EOS
mm EOS and it does add- EOS mm EOS it adds to me lunch when I go. I
used to go on the bus. EOS mm, yes. EOS But you get on the bus and
then there’s these girls that get on with their buggies, EOS mm, mm
EOS mm EOS dripping in cheap jewellery, EOS not a ring in sight, and
oh. If smoking was allowed they’d be smoking. EOS mm. EOS mm EOS I’m
not a snob EOS no EOS but you know, you do have certain standards
don’t you? EOS I think it’s the way we were brought up Maureen ,
respect. EOS Probably. EOS In those days. EOS Yeah. Yes probably. EOS
You respected your teachers and- EOS mm EOS and we went to church and
Sunday school, didn’t we? EOS Yes we did. We certainly did. EOS And
then the pictures after church on a Sunday night sometimes, the
Palladium. EOS Terribly naughty. EOS When you think about it. EOS mm,
yes we used to go on to the pictures after we’d been to church. EOS
mm. And we’d done our duty, hadn’t we? EOS we’d been to church. EOS
Well, definitely! Yes those were the days. EOS Happy days. EOS But I
think, I remember it being more difficult for food, clothes and
everything else after nineteen forty five. Because that’s when it was
really difficult, when they put bread on rationing. That was awful.
EOS Yes because rationing went on for quite some time, didn’t it? EOS
It went to about fifty two I think. EOS Yes it went on for some time.
EOS But it went worse- I don’t think we probably got the help from
America that we’d had during the war. EOS Or thought we were going to
get. EOS Yes. EOS That’s right. EOS yeah I think so, mm. EOS Because
there was the air base in Warrington wasn’t there? Burtonwood EOS Yes.
The Americans, mm. EOS erm and I know a friend of my auntie’s went out
with one of the airmen EOS mm EOS and er- he used to take to erm ,
girlfriend, loads of sweets and things. EOS Yeah. EOS mm EOS So you
know we had sweets. EOS Yes. EOS in that way. EOS Yes. EOS But it was
a long time before things were really back to normal. EOS Anything
like- well, above- above the counter. EOS That’s right EOS And on
show, everything was under the counter. EOS yeah. EOS Nothing was on
show. No food was on show. EOS And I know we had a chicken nearly ever
week and it was a friend of my granddad’s and me dad’s, used to get
these live chickens EOS mm EOS and they were in Pendleton, and I had
to go on the bus and bring back this chicken. EOS Dead chicken, was it
plucked? EOS Alive Maureen ! EOS Oh you didn’t! EOS I did. EOS And I’d
no choice, I had to do it. EOS How did you carry it? EOS It used to be
in a bag, and EOS I’d be sitting on the bus, terrified in case it made
a noise. EOS Our would say that he did it, but if he did it, I don’t
remember. It was me, because I was the eldest. EOS He might have come
on the odd occasion to keep me company. EOS mm EOS But in the main, it
was me. So we always had-. EOS Can I ask you, EOS chicken EOS did you
eat any of it when you got home? EOS Oh once me mum had killed it and
cleaned it and everything. EOS And prepared it, oh EOS And it- mainly
boiling **inc**. EOS yes, yes EOS And she used to make beautiful
chicken soup. EOS yes EOS And erm our always had the best of the
chicken. And me mum would hide it under his rice, so that and I
couldn’t see it. EOS Really? Oh that’s not right at all is it? EOS But
that’s how it was, he got the best. EOS It was, yes, he did. EOS And
er- I mean we laugh about it, EOS mm EOS and the thing is, although we
know that he was in a way favoured, it never, has never- EOS Any
animosity between you. EOS No. EOS mm EOS mm EOS There’s never been
any jealousy among us. EOS no. EOS Between the five of us, at all
really. EOS mm, mm, my mother lived on a farm, erm, and my grandfather
was a bailiff. EOS Oh yes. EOS Which was- it- you know he- he rented
and he worked for the farmer and it was in Warrington, cos he came
down all the way from the Lake District, how they got down I’ve no
idea. EOS No, no motorways. EOS But they always- no and they were on
this farm called , which is still there in- in Warrington, Daresbury
actually. EOS Yeah mm. EOS And my mother went to school at Daresbury
village. And erm she said that my father- my grandfather always had-
if they had an egg, they only got the top off the egg, EOS and gra-
and her father got the whole egg. EOS Cos he was the working- he was
working. EOS Yes, yes. EOS and he was providing. EOS mm, mm EOS And
she said there was ce- EOS there were- there were lots of vegetables,
and she said, ‘he never took anything that wasn’t his’. EOS no EOS And
she said, ‘we could’ve lived really well if he’d just- taken a few of
these veggies and brought them home.’ EOS Yeah, vegetables, mm EOS But
he never did. Never took anything that wasn’t theirs they were so
honest. EOS Wasn’t theirs. EOS Mm, then they went back of course, went
back to erm-. EOS The Lake District. EOS Yes went back to Ulverston,
mm EOS mm, I was looking at the Lake District on the telly the other
night, erm- did you watch it? EOS Yes, yes I did actually, I’d seen it
before. EOS Yes, I’ve seen it before but I watched it again. EOS Yes,
yes EOS Erm and I thought, ‘oh we did have some nice little **inc**
breaks up in the lake district.’ EOS Yes. My cousin that still lives
there, erm her grandson is erm- well his girlfriend, who lives on ,
which is the island that nobody’s- it’s private. EOS mmhmm, yes, in
the middle bit EOS Erm-. EOS I’ve often wondered if anybody lived
there. EOS yes, it’s a beautiful house EOS Is it, mm, mm EOS It’s the
that have got that. The people who had the insurance company,
insurance company. EOS mm, oh EOS And they bought the island and they
live there. And this is their daughter. And she swam the English
channel about two weeks ago. EOS Did she? EOS For charity, yes. EOS
She’s a st- I think she’s a student now, I- I th- - I’m not sure
whether- she’s got two grandsons, and I’m not sure whether this
particular grandson is the one that’s living locally in Manchester,
EOS oh EOS come down from the Lake District erm cos there are two of
them and I do get them confused and they’re both at university, or one
has finished. EOS mm, mm, yes, yeah. EOS But this girlfriend, yeah she
swam the English channel. Yes. EOS swam the channel. EOS Cos she- she
let me know the other week about it, yeah. EOS mm, what about hat
older lady swimming it? And kept going off course? EOS I know EOS Oh
did she, I’ve no- I didn’t see that. EOS Yeah and I’ve forgot- I’ve
forgotten how long it took her, EOS ooh EOS but she did it. But it
took her hours and hours. EOS The English Channel? EOS Hours and hours
and hours. EOS You’ve got the jellyfish problem with the English
Channel. EOS I know. EOS haven’t you, really? Mm, EOS yeah EOS Oh
gosh. EOS No it was nice, watching the Lake District, yes EOS Yes very
beautiful if it’s not raining. EOS Ooh, the very first time we went on
the Friday afternoon, it was raining so hard. EOS mm EOS ‘Oh what have
we done, why have we come?’ But then Saturday and Sunday it was
glorious. EOS mm, mm, beautiful, mm EOS Absolutely. EOS Mm, they’ve
had very bad weather this last winter. EOS Mm with the snow and
everything. EOS Yes a lot of- yes, yeah and rain. EOS I mean that’s
why I can’t understand the reservoirs being so low. EOS No but EOS
When we’ve had so much snow. EOS My cousin, when she was telling me
about these- this er grandson’s girlfriend. Erm she said, ‘oh you
wouldn’t believe how low they are.’ She said, ‘we’ve been out and
we’ve been looking and they’re extremely low.’ mm EOS I know when we
used to drive over to Harrogate erm on the M-sixty- two, we always
looked at one reservoir, Time EOS mm EOS ‘oh it’s a bit low this y-
this week.’ EOS mm EOS Do you know the one I mean? EOS Yeah, yeah I go
that way. EOS Yes and er we’d be sort of, ‘oh there’s going to be a
water shortage.’ EOS mm EOS mm EOS mm EOS our had to defy the hosepipe
ban before. EOS He what, sorry? EOS Had to defy the hosepipe ban.
Because our got all dog’s poo on his shoes. EOS oh, oh EOS And so he
had to swill them down. EOS Did he? I hope this is not being used in
evidence against him EOS for a thousand pounds. EOS I never thought
about that EOS Oh dear. EOS Confessions. EOS Confessions, yes. EOS mm,
well I mean, I use my hosepipe to fill my watering can and my gra- my
son-in-law said, ‘you can’t do that it’s illegal.’ I said, ‘rubbish.
It can’t be illegal.’ But I’ll tell you one thing. This hosepipe ban
is so ridiculous cos you waste more money- sorry more water. EOS More
water. EOS In a watering can. EOS yeah EOS Well I think so, Maureen
too. EOS Because you’re being- it’s pouring out and EOS yes EOS and if
it was coming out as a spray EOS a spray EOS and a shower, it would go
into the flowers and everything quicker. EOS Yes, yeah EOS But it’s
just going over the tops and- and going on the- one the road. On the
pavements. EOS I think it’s worse. EOS mm EOS I think it’s silly. EOS
Mm, I do. Yes, but still. EOS I can understand them saying the
hosepipe ban for washing cars at home. EOS Well at home but what about
these- EOS but you can still- EOS can you still take them to the-? EOS
Oh yes you can still take them to these places. EOS yeah EOS Places to
have them cleaned. Oh right, right. I didn’t realise that. EOS I mean
the gardeners that I have, said that he’d looked it up on the erm
internet EOS mmhmm EOS and it was so complicated, what you could, what
you couldn’t do, EOS oh yes, yes, EOS that in the end, he gave up. EOS
mm. EOS United utilities saying one thing, somebody else saying
something else, and he thought, ‘just don’t get it.’ EOS mmhmm, mm,
no. Well my- I’ve got one hanging basket, beautiful EOS mm EOS because
it’s rained on it and the other one is slightly under the porch EOS mm
EOS at the front door and it’s dead. EOS ahh EOS And never bothered
watering it. So I’ve had to get it down and just let the tap run on
it, EOS mm EOS so that’s wasted a lot of water. EOS Yeah, yeah, yeah.
EOS Today, whether it will revive, I don’t think it will. EOS mm, c-
It will, it will cos they said to me on Tuesday, I said, ‘I know what
you’re going to say,’ I said, ‘well you see it has rained so I thought
to myself ‘I don’t need to water them,’ EOS mm EOS ooh EOS But you
still need to water them, so-. EOS Oh gosh you do because it doesn’t
get through. EOS no EOS It only stays on the top. EOS yes EOS Hmm, how
are we doing? temporarily. This is marked within the transcription. difficult to

she cope? EOS because of it EOS doing anything EOS well, she doesn’t,
she was meant to come and get her hair cut yesterday, and then she had
to rearrange for three o’clock today, EOS I think she’s been sleeping
since yesterday, ‘til today so she can **inc** EOS there was a
programme on TV about that, about sleeping beauty, and she sleeps like
three weeks and she missed all her GCSE re- exams and then she woke up
for her prom, and like there’s nothing you can do, there’s nothing you
can take, yeah it was on BBC iPlayer EOS yeah, eventually it’s just
meant to like, wear off or something, but, she’s dead weird anyway
she’s like a d- EOS you think everyone’s weird EOS no, she’s like a
dead bohemian weirdo EOS a what? EOS bohemian EOS like a EOS like a

too much blonde in it’ EOS I can’t believe you told her EOS I can, erm
EOS I can’t EOS she was like, ‘there’s too much blonde in it’, but I
said to her, ‘ooh, I don’t know if I like it there’s quite a lot of
blonde in it’ then she hated it, then she was like, ‘there’s too much
blonde in it’ she was like, ‘will you get to put some’- EOS she’s only
got in her fringe and EOS yeah, no, but she had like twice the amount
of that blonde, all like here, just there, none at the back EOS so has

thing, that if you were a child and you had short hair, you’d have
lovely hair when you, erm, old, she’s- when you’re older, like, and
she’s Irish and she’s a weirdo, so that’s what she thought she was

setting all the tables up, and I went into the harness room and
looked, and one of the chefs is like, sat down like, writing stuff,
and then I’m looking and it’s bloody , I’m like, ‘oh my God, what is
he doing here’ EOS no EOS but then I realised, doing an- EOS who’s ?
EOS he’s one of the chefs, but he’s doing an apprenticeship with and
he had - erm, no, he had EOS oooh EOS and he had, erm, whats-his-name
grey hair he had and EOS ahh, ace EOS erm, for like his lessons, but
then comes every month and asks him like, what’s he’s done and he has
to do all this different cooking stuff and he’s like, ‘have you done
that?’, and like, ‘no’, and he’s like, ‘oh, I’ll just sign it off
anyway’ EOS he- he has got to be the worst teacher EOS so then he- he
comes up to me and he’s like, ‘so how- is this where you’ve been
hanging out?’ EOS **inc**, ‘have you handed all your work in?’, and I
was like, ‘yes’, erm, and I was like what was he going on about? he
was talking about some rubbish- EOS ah, do you know that came into our

sheet each week we had him EOS well, he didn’t though did he EOS he’s
just a knobhead EOS well, I told you he was **inc**- EOS I’ll always

the board and th- the higher and higher he goes EOS ahh, the arse EOS
the top- EOS tops coming out and you can just see more and more of his
arse, everyone’s like, ‘urgh’ EOS oh my God EOS and it’s like, ‘, why

**inc** EOS her best mate was like dying of cancer EOS yeah, but she
did often go in moods and stuff EOS mm EOS if you said stuff or- EOS
she never went in a mood with me, she did go in a mood in a restaurant
though when we EOS yeah she always seemed to take things too personal,
as well sometimes but my wor- EOS mm EOS my actual worst teacher I
think about when it- it’s gotta be from school when- she’s from and
she’s got like the strongest accent ever, erm, she had a baby, and she
was like- we were like, ‘what’ve you called your baby?’ and she’s
like, ‘’ , ‘oh, great’, and then erm, she got married and then we
weren’t sure if her name, EOS because she couldn’t say ‘haitches', we
weren’t sure if her name was or for like a year EOS why couldn’t she
say ‘haitches’? EOS cause she was that common EOS sounding she used to
call all time- EOS on away- he’s away EOS she used to speak to , and
erm, she’d call him and sh- he’d be like, ‘’ all the time and she’d- I
think she used to do it on purpose, say words with ‘haitches’ EOS
mmhmm EOS and she used to go, ‘do you want a chuffty badge?’ when- if
you thought, like, if you got something right or you were proud of
yourself or something EOS why would you want a chuffty badge? EOS and
she used to actually make them like, if you were doing something like,
creative, like ‘do a title page for your book’ she’d get like stickers
out and make a chuffty badge, like EOS oh I see EOS ‘here’s your
chuffty badge’ EOS standard EOS mm do you reckon who I’ll always
remember from college EOS go on EOS ? ah, that beasty EOS she’s- sh-

think it was the jogging pants that did it for me EOS oh, God EOS big
arse EOS that arse and then, who was it- that they always used to
wind- wind him up about like, ‘is your someone special?’, like, ‘no,
my someone special’s called ’ like, oh God EOS who’s ? EOS the one
that you were partners with in and didn’t know his name EOS oh aye EOS

one that works at EOS yeah, yeah EOS yeah EOS does he actually work at
the ? He does EOS well, he did, anyway, but so did that , you know the
pregnant one? EOS oh aye, she hated me EOS I think in the first year

food like, ‘Nadine , you need to eat, you’re gonna eat now’ EOS oh
yeah, cos you didn’t eat all day EOS no, I didn’t eat the whole first
day EOS no, it was disgusting that place EOS I don’t think I could
cope being a runner, seeing the kitchen EOS eurgh, the lunches were
horrible there, whenever I think about- EOS why would you pay like,
nearly hundred and something quid f- EOS the buffet was alright but,
it was just the bloody- EOS we never had the buffet in ours then EOS

mayonnaise sandwiches, I was like, eurgh, not eating that EOS I
wouldn’t mind but you didn’t even have hot water most of the time,
that coffee- coffee was minging EOS I know EOS I remember serving
coffee and it’s just so rank EOS the cakes were good there but then
there was that bitchy chef that always used to come over and be like,
‘you can’t save all the cakes’, like, ‘well, we don’t wanna save all
of them, but we’re not gonna chuck them all away, people are hungry’
EOS ‘people aren’t gonna’ chefs are well mean EOS I know EOS our chefs
are mean at work, but yeah, they get away with murder as well EOS
chefs can just be mean at times, can’t they? EOS yeah, can’t they EOS
I’m not a chef EOS no, you just stand there and look pretty EOS you do
though EOS oh, I’ll have to be a chef on Wednesday though EOS gutted
not coming to your **inc** kitchen I might come and complain EOS and
you’ll be like, ‘ahh, is this Nadine ?’ EOS yeah EOS it’s so annoying,
they’ll- and they’ll probably ask me like, ‘is there this and this’,
I’ll be like, ‘I don’t know’, some woman came up to me yesterday and
w- well, not yesterday the other day when I was really, really busy,
the only one behind the hot plate, and she was like this, ‘can I just
ask you a few questions about the ingredients?’, I was like, ‘in a
minute’ EOS Alan , Alan , Alan , you already told me this last night
mate EOS oh EOS even though you can’t remember the conversation we had
I can EOS what when she g- the one that couldn’t have tomatoes, yeast
or gluten? EOS yeah and then there was one about peppers, and she was
allergic to peppers EOS oh yeah EOS and then she’d EOS just peppers,
which is weird EOS yeah, but she asked you about the red and- EOS red
and green EOS green, but she’s actually allergic to all of them EOS
yeah, ‘any red or green peppers in it?’ ‘no’, ‘what about the other
colours?’ I was like, ‘why don’t you ask me if there’s any peppers in
it?’ EOS standard yeah, just cos you can’t remember EOS oh, it’s
getting warm in here again EOS do you want me to open the door? EOS
it’s the brightness I think EOS windy though isn’t it pretty windy EOS

erm, from the very first day? EOS your very first day EOS remember
having take- picture taken at the front door EOS did you? EOS mm EOS I
didn’t EOS have you not seen my pictures? EOS I remember my blazer was
like three times- sizes too big for me EOS you had a blazer? EOS I had
a black blazer EOS eurgh, minging I wore my summer dress the first day
EOS did you? EOS yeah EOS in year seven? EOS oh, in year seven? I
thought you meant like primary school EOS I don’t- oh, I remember
hiding behind my Mum’s coat in primary school EOS why? EOS she had a
big long coat, and I didn’t wanna say hi to anyone, so I lifted the
coat up and stood under it EOS you pussy I remember when high school,
there was like the bikes and erm, my sister’s like, ‘right, wait
there’ EOS ten past three, ‘don’t move until I’m here, wait there
Nadine wait there’ I went, ‘okay’ and then I met and then we walked
round and saw like all our chum mates and that was it EOS erm EOS and
we used to all get lost as a four, just to be late to lesson, standard
EOS I remember on the second day, erm, of school we had PE EOS I
remember in the first day of year two I was- told my Mum she didn’t
need to come and pick me up again, I’m walking home and my Mum never
p- walked to school **inc** pick me up ever again so yeah, and erm EOS
that’s good EOS oh yeah EOS hmm EOS it wasn’t that far really from me
house, it was quite far actually for year twos EOS pah EOS mm, mm, mm,
mm EOS so why is coming round apart from pick the bag up? EOS just to
pick the stuff up EOS oh, so you’re not staying? EOS no EOS moody
bitch EOS we’ve gotta- he’s cutting her hair at three o’clock and
he’ll have to be quick or she’ll fall asleep EOS can’t she just like
fall asleep and then you just do it EOS that’d be a bit dangerous
someone trying to cut their hair EOS hmm, suppose EOS imagine if she
started sleep walking like that guy EOS ahhh, that guy was mank, I
swear we’re gonna watch that on CTV EOS I wanna see it EOS ahh, no,
did I tell you about getting told off from the CTV camera? EOS no EOS
hot plate, - sprawled out across the thingy, right was like showing it
to , comes in cos we’re like laying up the chalet, and goes, ‘who’s
this, who’s this?’ and I was ‘oh, that was before on the hot plate’,
went ape shit at him, honest to God, it was so funny EOS why’s getting
involved though? EOS cause came into see us cos she’s been away, and
she’s like missed them, so she came into see us all, and then she was
like, ‘right, what’s the goss’ and then she went to and was like, ‘ah,
come and have a look at this, come what did’ I wouldn’t mind, but he
only came in at eight, and then he ha- he was like sprawled across,
and was like, ‘I wouldn’t mind but you didn’t even go out last night’
EOS ‘don’t agree to breakfast if you couldn’t’ he was the one who got
us into trouble with the customers, apparently we’re moody people and
we don’t wanna be here so EOS the other week, well, no, this week,
erm, some woman came into work and erm, she was speaking to and was
like, ‘right, so, what we want is, we want the erm, late lunch’ and
she was like, ‘I don’t know if the late lunch is on today actually’
and then she was like, ‘well, it’s outside’ and so then she was like-
EOS what’s a late lunch? EOS the late- it’s just a menu that we do
when the regular lunches come off, we do a late lunch, so, they do t-
like, cos they normally don’t do stuff to order, they do shepherds pie
EOS scampi, and erm, sticky mango chicken- EOS so it’s a bit like a
buffet EOS no, cos they cook it f- like, to order EOS mm EOS and you
get it brought over to you and everything, so, but the main lunch was
still out, so she goes and asks if they’re doing it, and then erm, she
was like he said something like, erm, ‘we won’t be doing it until
like, half three’ or something, then she was like, ‘right, can we
order it now, and come back’ or something and then she was like,
‘right, we want two child’s portions of the shepherds pie’ EOS why
child? EOS she goes, ‘well, we can’t do child’s portions of the
shepherds pie’ she’s like, ‘why?’, ‘they’re already portioned up in an
adults portion, and they’re that price, and it doesn’t say anywhere
that we can do a child’s portion’ and she’s like, ‘well, we want
child’s portions, this is absolutely ridiculous’ so she’s basically on
one, she’s having a go at erm, then like, wouldn’t stop, I don’t know
what even she was saying to her, I kind of looked over at her, and
then in the end she was like, ‘it’s not very good, you’re loosing five
customers here that nanana’ EOS and going on with herself, in the end
she walks out, I turned to and said, ‘are you alright?’ like this, and
then she smiles and kind of goes, ‘yeah’ and kind of like laughed it
off, but kind of just to say, ‘yeah, it’s fine’, the woman comes back
like, thirty seconds later, ‘I don’t think it’s right that you’re
laughing at us as soon as we leave’, I was like, EOS ‘excuse me, we
weren’t laughing at her, I asked her if she was alright’, and she was
like, ‘no, I don’t think it’s very funny, you’re laughing at us and
we’re walking away, you’re- this EOS what was that? mm EOS **inc** EOS
yeah, think so EOS ahh EOS I’m just gonna carry on anyway EOS yeah,
carry on EOS **inc** erm EOS so what else did she say EOS she just
said that really EOS didn’t she walked away and you laughed again? EOS
yeah, then she walked away, and no-one even realised EOS well you- to
be fair, you were laughing EOS no, we weren’t laughing, I asked her if

weekend, me and my sister, that’s what I did with my sister, go
swimming with the floats, and you know if you had arm bands you
weren’t allowed to go past like a certain, like- EOS did you ever put
armbands on someone’s feet? EOS no EOS I did EOS nearly died, the
lifeguard goes, he was like, ‘take them off, now’ EOS why? EOS because
EOS you put armbands on your feet, and you go like that, and as soon
as you let go they go, pff, like that and you go upside down EOS
standard EOS and they’re like stuck on your ankles EOS so you can’t
get them off either EOS which ones did you have? Them blow-up ones
that you couldn’t put on your arm like , and you can ne- EOS pink ones
EOS pink EOS yeah EOS you’re a boy EOS yeah, no, they weren’t like EOS
my bum’s sore now EOS bought them cos they were pink, they were like
the pink ones that they sold there cos they had like yellow ones- EOS
do you remember the rubber ring ones that you can get now EOS no EOS
yeah EOS but anyway, as I was saying, when swimming EOS bum’s sore EOS
like when we were on holiday, he’ll like go in and he looks like- like
he’s like, his neck’s like this, like the water’s there EOS and- and-
so he’s like this, and then every now and again he’ll go under and
he’ll be like spitting water out, like, EOS oh my God, and he
constantly looks like he’s just going to die EOS like he’s stand
there, and he’s like- and he always grabs onto people like, ‘’ and
then EOS so as you as you get, like, when we’re on holiday, he’ll like
be drowning me and I’ll do like, that to him and- EOS can he not swim?
EOS he can swim, just about, like, with that **inc** EOS like, dying,
I’m like, ‘oh my God, you’re the worst swimmer ever’ EOS I bet you’re
not that good EOS I’m better than him anyway EOS I bet you’re not that

six, oh not in high school, no, we never did it in high school EOS you
didn’t do it in high school? Jammy **inc** EOS no, we only did it in
Primary EOS we had to do it all the way to year, erm, eleven, it’s
only cos people couldn’t swim in our class EOS no, they seriously
couldn’t, no-one could swim in our class apart from me EOS it’s like,
really bad, she’d right- ‘we’ll do front crawl’, and we all had to
like, be in the lanes cos, to like, our class was that small we had
one lane each EOS and no joke, she says, ‘do front crawl’, no one
could do it, they’ll do doggy paddle, she’s like, ‘ah, do backstroke’,
everyone could do backstroke apart from the ones who used to just kick
their legs EOS yeah, I know, your arm- EOS and then- EOS your arms
don’t really help with backstroke though, I don’t think EOS no, I
never see the point, and then erm, EOS you just always wet your face
and stuff EOS the breaststroke cou- no-one could- everyone could do
the arms, but then they didn’t do the legs EOS right, they just like
kicked their legs, EOS no, you don’t do, yeah EOS but if you don’t do
your legs right you co- it doesn’t work the same, cos you’re meant to
glide in the s- yeah EOS you see, yeah, I’m a geek really, and then
erm yeah, no-one could do butterfly apart from me, everyone used to
stand there and- EOS what’s butterfly? EOS the one where you go, pfff
EOS never even done that in my life EOS and you know that one that
you’ve gotta lie on your back but you’ve got to like go forward oh,
okay EOS no EOS it’s like the, yeah, it is, it’s like an unusual one,
and then we used to have to spin all the way down and then you used to
have to jump in the pool to extend your legs apparently, d- EOS could
you dive? EOS no, we weren’t allowed to EOS oh EOS I remember you did
a belly flop once, it was so funny EOS do you know what was the- were

used to be good EOS **inc** EOS and no-one ever wanted to go in the
deep end EOS I’ve never pl I was gonna, ah- I was gonna ask the most
stupid question then EOS go on EOS it wasn’t about the horses in water
polo anyway EOS I’m really confused EOS g- I couldn’t remember what it
was for a second I was like, ‘oh yeah, polo’s the one with the horses
isn’t it, how do horses play water polo’ yeah, that was a bit of a
stupid one EOS okay, wait
