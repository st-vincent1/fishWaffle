EOS I did get into trouble once, it was something to do with a bird.
EOS Really? EOS And someb- I think the boy that got me into trouble,
somebody called who lived on . EOS mmhmm EOS But I can’t remember
exactly how it all came about. EOS But I know wasn’t very happy. EOS
oh EOS Ah. Well I remember getting into trouble at that school and I
got the cane. EOS Oh I got the cane for it. EOS Did you? EOS Yes, yes.
EOS I was late, I’ve never been late in my life, and I still hate
being late for anything. EOS Well I’m-. EOS And I dawdled on the way
to school and suddenly I realised that the doors were locked and I
couldn’t get in. And I had to stand waiting while they did the
prayers. EOS How old were you then? EOS Erm I was in the junior
school, so possibly about eleven. Ten or eleven. And I got the- this
cane on my l- on my hand EOS who gave you that? ? EOS and it was- EOS
He was a bit handy with his cane, wasn’t he? EOS And do you know it
really hurt, it- and I was so mortified that I had to stand there in

Difficult years to be a child in. EOS Yes. EOS Erm wondering from one
day to the next whether the Germans would arrive on the doorstep. EOS
Cos we had shelters didn’t we? EOS We did at school, which we had to
go into. EOS Yes. EOS And practice for air-raids. EOS yes, air raids,
mm EOS I got thumped in one of those, I remember, very, very hard in
the dark. EOS Really? EOS Somebody thumped me, we never knew who it
was. But er-. EOS Well you wouldn’t in the dark, no EOS No . EOS But I
quite enjoyed . EOS I did actually. It was a church school. EOS Yes.
EOS It was always a very good school. But as far as favourite teacher
goes erm-. Left channel resumes EOS Was there one called ? EOS Yes.
EOS I think she was a favourite. EOS Yes possibly, she came from
Irlam. EOS That’s right. EOS Mm, she did. EOS with the strap in the
corner. EOS oh EOS She used to frighten me to death. But she was a
very, very good teacher. Was her name ? EOS Right. EOS She used to
play the piano. EOS I don’t remember that name. EOS And if we didn’t
sing- she taught us ‘Jerusalem’ and if we didn’t sing it correctly, oh
my word! She was very strict. No right channel EOS right, right, I
remember . Now she was extremely strict. EOS . EOS Very strict lady.
She was a large lady and she was very, very strict, everyone was
frightened of her. EOS Well I think-. EOS As far as your first day at
school, that school- I actually, had been up in the lake district cos
I’d been evacuated erm to my aunt’s. And I do not remember really my
first day at school but I do remember at the infants. And I do
remember you and with your lovely dark black hair EOS that was cut you
know, with your fringes. I remember looking and thinking, ‘ooh what
lovely hair!’ EOS I remember my first day. Cos I was five when I went.
Right channel resumes) EOS Right. EOS And I think the teacher was
called EOS oh EOS And I can picture the classroom. EOS And our younger
than me, she cried because she wanted to come as well. So she started
as well, shortly afterwards. No right channel EOS Oh, oh right. EOS
Erm- but then our had appendicitis M did she EOS and she was rushed to
hospital. EOS Right. EOS And she missed quite a bit of schooling
because of it. EOS ooh, cos it was a big operation. EOS It was in
those days, yes. Cos they were frightened it might be peritonitis. EOS
Yes. EOS Because , my dad’s sister, she had died at fourteen EOS oh
right EOS with peritonitis. Erm and we always felt that she never
quite caught up, because she missed-. EOS So much. EOS The grounding,
you know, the basics. She’s alright now but that’s the way we felt.
Right channel resumes EOS mm, mm, summer holidays for me were again,
back in the Lake District. EOS yes, yeah EOS Erm I used to go on
**inc**. EOS We used to go on coach trips, Stratford upon Avon. EOS
Yes, yes EOS Erm I didn’t go to Scarborough. Erm, round Wales. EOS
Right. EOS Me dad used to take us to New Brighton on the bus. EOS Oh
right. EOS But that’s as far as it went in those days, cos people
didn’t go on holiday, did they really? EOS mm, no they didn’t no. Well
you couldn’t because there was no seaside to go to, because it was
mined, all the beaches. I do remember going to Blackpool once. EOS Yes
I remember Blackpool. EOS And it was all barbed wire and you weren’t
allowed on the beach to play. Erm I presume it was all mined and you
know, waiting for an invasion. EOS mm, mm EOS So beaches were just you
know-. EOS A no go area. EOS No go areas yes. Yes. EOS But having said
that, I mean- our school days- we never went short. We were never
short of food or anything like that. EOS No, it wasn’t very good at
times. EOS We made the most of what we had, erm EOS Yes and I still
hate celery. EOS I’ve never really taken to celery. EOS raw celery, I
hate, but I love it in stews. I do actually like it. EOS Do you? EOS
Yes, in stews. EOS I eat it because puts it in EOS yes EOS but I can’t
say that it’s one of me favourite things. EOS Yes, no. But I think- I
think it was very difficult for our parents to feed- I mean, there
were th- three of us, ‘til was born. EOS mm EOS had my sister, in
nineteen forty four, so- it was hard to- everything was so rationed.
EOS It was. EOS It was dreadful, you queued for everything. EOS
Everything. EOS you ate EOS And sweets, when you think nowadays the
shops are absolutely full of them. EOS Yes, yes. EOS I suppose we were
lucky that erm my aunties were still at home and they gave us their
sweet coupons. EOS Sweet coupons, yes. EOS And we used to go to . EOS
Oh yes, yes. EOS And er the main thing we had were Barley sugars. EOS
Oh gosh, really? EOS And occasionally a treat, with a crunchie. EOS mm
EOS But it was- that was all you could get in those days. EOS mm EOS
And then there was the powdered egg, EOS powdered milk EOS Oh gosh
that American powdered egg. EOS Canned coffee, ooh. EOS We w- we were
very lucky, we had erm- my grandfather wrote to a lady in America who
had been the fiancée of an uncle. EOS Who died in the first world war.
EOS mm, mm EOS And she went out and married someone else. And went out
to America and she sent us food parcels, all the way through the war.
EOS Oh that was nice, yeah. EOS She was very religious and the church
that she went to, they collected for the English people. EOS Really?
EOS And they used to send us some wonderful things over. EOS yeah EOS
Erm and it must’ve been quite expensive to get it over in those days,
EOS over in tho- yes EOS they wouldn’t be flown over. EOS No, no. EOS
It would’ve come by boat. EOS It’d take weeks! EOS The only thing I
hated was the wintergreen sweets that they sent. EOS Oh I don’t
remember those. I never had those. EOS Oh they were dreadful, they
were American, wintergreen, and the chocolate was bad as well. EOS
Urgh. EOS And I- I never liked those. EOS Well even now I don’t think
their chocolate is as nice as ours. EOS I don’t, no. EOS Because and
love Thorntons, EOS mm, mm EOS in particular you know, the erm special
toffee. And when me mum used to visit erm in Chicago. EOS mm, mm EOS
Take some decent cadburies chocolates. EOS yes, yes, yes. EOS yes not
as nice as hours. EOS But they used to send- also, they collected
clothes. EOS mm EOS Clothes that were practically new. And I
absolutely hated them. Because my mother cut them down, EOS to fit me
and they were American style sleeves. EOS yes and you felt different.
EOS And I was different at school in them. And I absolutely hated
them. EOS I don’t remember that Maureen . I don’t remember. EOS And
they were beautiful things, I’m sure. EOS Yes, yes, mm EOS But they
weren’t what I wanted. But there were no clothes. EOS I know, well-.
EOS Very difficult to get. EOS Cos I know when people got married- I
th- got married at the end of the war, and it wasn’t a white outfit,
it was sort of a two piece, EOS mm, mm EOS with a great big hat. EOS
Hats, mm. EOS She always wore a hat didn’t she? EOS mm, Well I- I
remember my mother making my eldest sister- half sister, erm, wedding
cake. That would be probably nineteen- was born in forty four, so this
would be forty five, I think. EOS mm EOS And my mum- my mother had got
all the cake mixture, black market cake mixture of course. EOS Yes,
yes EOS Erm and she made this wedding cake and she took it out of the
oven and it fell into three pieces. EOS oh no EOS oh your poor mum!
EOS And she was absolutely horrified because she’d been a cook, that
was her- what she did as a young woman, EOS mm EOS and I think she got
the almond paste and stuck it together. EOS ‘gether . EOS Where the
cracks were. And iced over it and nobody knew any different. EOS knew
EOS So that- but that stuck in my mind and yes, that’s amazing. EOS
Yes, yes. EOS Erm but I used to- I did a lot of the queuing fo- for
food. EOS But we had to do, didn’t we? EOS Yes because my mother had
obviously had my sister in nineteen forty four EOS mm EOS and I used
to go and do all the-. EOS I did the er- most of the errands. EOS Did
you do it as well Vivienne ? EOS Yes EOS mm EOS . EOS Yes. EOS Cake
shop EOS yes EOS and we used to go to on the other side of the
trinity. Erm-. EOS Mm, yes. EOS And everything you know was sort of
weighed and very precise. EOS Oh absolutely. When you watch these- I
love the history programmes EOS mm EOS and I do watch them and you
know, what went on in the war years. And they’re absolutely perfect
because you know, they are true footage. EOS I know. EOS Of what it
was like and it makes you think, ‘how did we ever survive?’ EOS Well
we did, didn’t we? EOS mm EOS We never went short. Never went short.
EOS No, we had probably just about enough but er-. EOS Yes **inc** and
yet it’s not done us any harm, has it? When you think about it. EOS
Well we’re still here at seventy four and touch our toes, Vivienne .
EOS I don’t know that I can touch my toes. EOS mm, I can. EOS Can you?
EOS Yes. Oh gosh yes. EOS Mind you I’ve never tried but I’m sure I
can’t. EOS No EOS I’m sure I can’t. Oh dear. EOS yeah, yeah, well
we’ve got our own teeth. EOS Oh I haven’t. EOS Oh sorry EOS Well I
have half, the bottom. But I had mine out at twenty six. EOS Oh did
you? EOS Because I had terrible teeth. EOS Oh right, right. EOS Look
at her laughing! EOS I know EOS Terrible teeth. EOS We’ve got our own
hair colour! EOS Oh yeah and- well-. EOS Well yes! EOS With a bit of
help EOS The hairdresser’s very helpful EOS Absolutely. Erm, yes. EOS
Erm you know and what else? Well I’ve got contact lenses. I fool
everyone cos I’ve got contact lenses. EOS Ooh no I just- I couldn’t
put those in, I couldn’t mess with my eyes. EOS Oh gosh yes, yeah EOS
I couldn’t. EOS I’ve had them about- oh I don’t know, twenty five
years, probably now. EOS Really? EOS mm, since I- I’m more-. EOS I
need my glasses for reading but I just couldn’t- EOS yes, mm EOS if I
had to wear them all the time, I’d have to wear them. Just couldn’t
put contact lenses in. does. But I couldn’t. EOS Erm, well my grandson
who’s eleven, well twelve tomorrow. He use- he has contact lenses, .
EOS Does he? EOS And what a difference it’s made to his life, and I
taught him how to do it. EOS Oh I’m sure. Really, yes. EOS Yes, and
erm I did explain it and I keep saying, you know, ‘you must wash your
hands, all the time!’ EOS Ooh hands going near your eyes. EOS You
don’t want to get infected eyes. And I spent a long time- . EOS mm,
Explaining it to him. EOS Explaining how to do it, and do you know,
he- he was brilliant. EOS mm EOS And he’s so thrilled because he
doesn’t have to wear glasses any more. EOS yes. EOS mm EOS Yes, made a
big difference to him at school. EOS Because children generally don’t
like wearing glasses. EOS They’re quite cruel aren’t they? Some of
them. EOS Oh they are yes. Yes that’s right. EOS But yes. EOS I mean
on the whole I think my school days were happy days. EOS Yes I’m sure
mine were really, yes. EOS But then after we parted company didn’t we?
EOS We did Vivienne you went to the grammar school. EOS I went to
school. EOS And I went to a technical col- commercial college. EOS mm,
yes. And I suppose I did sports at the grammar school. EOS And w- and-
yes. EOS Erm hockey, rounders, athletics. EOS Yes. EOS School choir.
But I m- that’s a bit like that now. All gone by the board. EOS No EOS
I think they just had netball at when I went there. EOS Did they? Well
they had netball but I- EOS mm EOS I think being on the short side, I
wasn’t very good at netball. EOS No, no. EOS I was better at hockey.
EOS You are better when you’re tall, yes. EOS And yet funny, my best
friend, who was taller than me, you know, . EOS Yes oh yes. EOS She
was good at the high jump. I did the long jump. She did netball, I did
hockey. We just did opposite things. EOS mm, mm, yes. EOS And I think
that’s partly to do with her being so much taller than me. EOS Taller,
yes, yes. EOS mm EOS mm EOS mm. EOS Now then. Funniest memories from
when we were young. EOS And as far as brothers and sisters of course,
I had- my father sadly lost his first wife with consumption as they
called it in those days. Er in nineteen twenty nine or stroke thirty.
Erm my sister was three. And my brother was a baby, about six months
old. EOS mm, mm EOS And my father was working, because of all the
problems with like today, jobs that are difficult. EOS Yes. EOS And of
course the twenties and thir- well the twenties was very difficult.
And he went to live in Yorkshire. And-. EOS yeah- whereabouts in
Yorkshire? EOS Well I can’t just remember now, though I’m trying very
hard to. There was a very large erm- water supply, a big erm-. EOS
Reservoir. EOS Yes and it f- I think it fed Leeds I think, up there,
but it’s beautiful up there. And they had-. EOS Is it the reservoir
that you see when you’re on the M-sixty two? Going towards-. EOS No,
no it isn’t. EOS no EOS Erm and I have photographs of my father up a
telegraph pole, cos he was electrician. EOS Oh was he? EOS Wiring it
all up. And they had houses as well, and that- my sister took me about
four or five years ago and the foundations of the houses which were
stone were still there. Just the foundations, EOS mm EOS you could see
where they were. Erm and the water authority, it hadn’t been open
actually to the public and they’d o- EOS mm EOS they’d o- they’d only
just opened this particular spot. EOS mm EOS Erm and so it was quite
you know, interesting to go. EOS Yes, yes. EOS And obviously my
father’s been dead twenty years now. Erm but-. EOS Do you know I
thought it would’ve been more than that, Maureen . EOS My father? EOS
Mm. EOS Erm, well my mother- father twen- EOS mother twenty and my
father twenty two I think. EOS Really? Mm. EOS And then what happened,
she got this consumption living there. Sadly and had to go to er a
sanatorium. And he took his two children back to Windermere where he
came from. EOS mm EOS And his mother looked after them. EOS Looked
after them, brought them up. EOS And that’s how he met my mother EOS
mm EOS there. Erm, so it was quite- really quite sad. EOS Sad yes
yeah. EOS Yeah for him erm-. EOS Well I can still picture your mother
and father, you know- big weren’t they? EOS Mm, yeah they were. Yes.
EOS Tall, and I know when I used to go shopping in Peel Green to the
butchers and your mum would be walking along, and I’d say, ‘how’s
Maureen ? Another little girl!’ EOS another little girl, Yes. EOS
Another little girl, one two three four. EOS Yes, mhmm. EOS Oh yes.
But then you see, what happened with- with grandchildren. Six
grandsons. EOS yeah EOS yes EOS And three granddaughters. EOS mm, mm
EOS And five boys, one after the other. We didn’t have any girls at
all. EOS Yes that’s right. Funny that. EOS Mm. But erm-. EOS Just I do
remember when we used to go to church and you were in the choir, like
was in the choir. EOS mm, mm EOS And used to go to , Christmas Eve,
carol singing. EOS mm, really mm. EOS And your Mum, I remember one
year in particular your mum gave us all erm hot chocolate before we
went. EOS ahh EOS Did she really Vivienne ? EOS yes one Christmas eve.
EOS Ooh you can remember things better than me. EOS Yeah, she gave us
erm hot chocolate before we all set off for church. EOS Oh really. EOS
yeah. EOS Gosh, mm EOS Happy days those, really. EOS Oh, yes, that’s-
it is, probably were, yes. EOS But you and -. EOS But you never got
much for Christmas, I certainly didn’t. There were just no toys at
all. EOS Well you couldn’t- I think. EOS in the forties EOS The one
thing I remember getting at Christmas was a very nice- and it was off
a friend of my mum and dad’s. EOS A pencil box with a- that’s erm
roller top. EOS Oh I know. Yeah. EOS But, you know, you come down
Christmas day, and your presents would be on the table. There’d be
mine, and . EOS Mm. EOS Because that was it, wasn’t it, EOS mm EOS mm
EOS and a bit of fruit? EOS mm EOS Whatever- you know. EOS That’s
right and a few nuts. You alw- I had a pillowcase, always had a
pillowcase and there was nuts in the bottom, a tangerine and an apple.
EOS mm, oh a tangerine. Yes. EOS And erm they were- I don’t know that
it was quite exciting to have those at the very bottom. EOS Mm. EOS
But I used to be so upset when there was nothing left in it at all.
EOS And wishing there were more things, but there were no books
Vivienne EOS no EOS and I never had a doll for- I never played with
dolls. EOS I- I wasn’t a doll person, I did have one and I didn’t like
it. EOS mm, well my mother-. EOS I did have a nice doll’s pram. EOS
Yes. EOS And bicycle that me granddad bought. EOS vv EOS But it wasn’t
at Christmas, it was sort of later on. EOS Yes. EOS When you could
afford it. EOS exactly. Yes, yes. EOS You know cos they worked- worked
hard. EOS Well I do remember a book that I was bought. Two books- one
was ‘The prisoner of Zenda’ and ‘Rupert of Hensor.’ EOS Oh I don’t
remember that but I remember the first one. EOS And they were hideous
books, they were far too old for me. EOS I was just thinking that. EOS
And I c- I don’t really think I ever read them really. EOS No. EOS but
there were no children’s books. But from the post office, her parents
could always find Rupert books. EOS Could they? EOS Mm, she always had
the annuals for Rupert. And I was lucky, because she used to lend them
to me. EOS Yes, yes EOS You know, and so I could read them. But I
never had any books. And my mother, desperate to get me a doll she
went to the doll’s hospital in Manchester. EOS Oh I remember the
doll’s hospital. EOS And you remember that Vivienne . EOS Mm. EOS
Bought two heads and sewed them on this- these bodies she’d made. EOS
mm EOS And I had- I always had a black doll. EOS mm EOS I absolutely
loved black dolls, EOS mm EOS mm EOS more than white dolls. Cos I just
had this attraction f- for black dolls. And she got me a black and a
white one. And I went to see my friend at the time. EOS She’s a mutual
friend, . EOS oh, okay EOS Yeah. EOS We went to school with her,
didn’t we? EOS Yes, yeah. And dropped one of my dolls EOS and the head
smashed into pieces. EOS no EOS And I was so horrified I lifted my
arms up and dropped mine. So I had no dolls. EOS none at all EOS So
both the heads had gone. EOS Oh what a shame and your mum had gone to
all that trouble. EOS mm, yes, yes. Yeah, she w- she wasn’t- wasn’t
particularly good at sewing. But erm, she went to quite a bit of
trouble to try and make up for what wasn’t there. EOS Something- What
we couldn’t have. EOS What we didn’t have, exactly. EOS Yes. EOS But
my sister arriving in forty four. Everything went to her. EOS Er the-
I- I could not remember what a banana looked like. I hadn’t ever had
one, you see, EOS mm EOS that I could remember. EOS I can’t remember
when I was little, no. Because I was three in thirty nine. So when the
bananas came, erm-. EOS Now I don’t know how many there were, whether
there was only one, but my father- it had to be that had the banana.
EOS mm EOS I remember looking at this and thinking, ‘I wonder what it
really does taste like?’ EOS really does taste like. EOS And I didn’t
find out, and I wonder why they did that in those days. EOS They
could’ve given you half each. EOS Could’ve given us half each, EOS mm
EOS yes EOS yes they could actually. Erm so everything went to . Erm
but it never affected me in any way. EOS Never bothered you, no I
mean-. EOS I was never jealous. EOS I was the first grandchild,
spoilt. And then there was and then was the first grandson. And he was
spoilt. EOS mm, mm, mm EOS But because I suppose my nanna and
granddad- granddad in particular with I was- me nanna was for me. EOS
Me mum and dad tried to make it up to . They gave her more. EOS mm,
yes, yeah. EOS Like I went to the grammar school, went to the grammar
school, so erm- made sure that went to . EOS Oh right, yes EOS And got
a city and guilds in erm-. EOS yes, catering, wasn’t it? EOS catering,
yes. EOS yes, yeah EOS And then of course, and EOS yes EOS came along
later on. EOS Yes, a lot later. EOS yes EOS But my grandparents lived
in , as you know, and my grandmother would give my half brother half a
crow, which was quite a bit of money. EOS Ooh a lot of money in those
days. EOS And I was given sixpence. EOS I never had what he had.
Because he was the son, EOS son, mm EOS you know, the grandson. And
apparently my father used to get so upset about it and so annoyed,
he’d take me home and give me half a crown. EOS mm, crown as well. EOS
ahh, **inc** EOS Yes. Just to make it up. EOS mm, cos we used to joke,
you know me mum made a lot of our clothes for and I. EOS Yes, yeah EOS
And of course we’d say- course our ’s came from Kendal Mills EOS Yes,
yeah. They were like that with sons. EOS But erm- yes, yes. EOS For
some reason and we’ve got far more equality today. EOS mm EOS And you
don’t treat your children any different at whatever age. EOS No, me
mum and dad didn’t really, erm. EOS No. EOS Erm, because er- we’ve got
a photograph of the three of us and a friend of had knitted these
fair-isle cardigans in two ply. EOS mm, gosh. EOS and I had cardigans,
had erm- I think it was a v-neck sweater. EOS mm, mm EOS And me mum
made sure that the three of us had the same. EOS Yes. Yes, quality,
mm, yeah. EOS Yes, yeah. Tried to treat us all the same. EOS mm EOS
But erm- now then, what did I help out in the house a lot? Well I had
to do. EOS yes I’m sure I did, I’m sure we had to really. EOS Yes. EOS
Didn’t we? EOS mm EOS Erm washing up was always a pain, cos nobody
wanted to dry. EOS no EOS It’s strange nobody likes drying isn’t it?
EOS No, no, nobody wanted to dry. So we used to argue, the three of
us, cos was too young. EOS mm EOS Erm and they used to- did they have
no washing up liquid Vivienne ? EOS Oh I don’t remember washing up-.
EOS It was Persil. EOS Persil, no washing up liq- EOS We used to put
washing powder in EOS really EOS and wash the pots in washing powder.
EOS I don’t remember washing up liquid. EOS No. EOS At all. EOS Oh
they didn’t have it, no, no, and my mother-. EOS But when you think no
washing up liquid, no washing machine, or things like that. EOS No- no
they boiled everything, didn’t they, in a boiler, EOS mm EOS but I do
remember my mother grating fairy soap, white blocks- sorry green
blocks of fairy soap. EOS Green blocks of fairy soap. EOS And she
would grate it into the dolly tub. EOS Yes. EOS Er with boiling water
so it melted, EOS yeah EOS an- and became- EOS so it would clean the
clothes properly. EOS mm, and then they- EOS And they always washed on
a Monday. EOS And ironed on a tuesday. EOS Yes, yes. If they got it
dry. EOS Yes, routine, routine EOS mm, was routine. And we had a
cellar, where my mother had clothes lines. EOS We had cellars. EOS And
she used to hang her clothes EOS mm EOS in the cellar to dry. And we
did have a very old coke burner down there for when the sirens went
and there was bombing. EOS Oh the sirens yes. EOS yeah and- and erm,
my grandfather had gone to the railways and he was a joiner, when he
was younger and lived in the Lake District. But he came down to live
with us and erm he went and got all these- erm, this- these pieces of
wood from the railway that- sleepers. EOS mm EOS And he propped the
whole of the ceiling of the cellar up in case we had an air-raid or a
bomb- EOS yes we had our own sort of shelter at four-two-seven. EOS
yes EOS At six-six-three you used to go down in the cellar. EOS yes
EOS But erm I remember my nan, my nanna and heard the sirens. Went
down into the cellar. came home from work to find them in the cellar.
‘What you doing in the cellar?’ ‘Well you know, the sirens went.’
They’d gone down for the all-clear, hadn’t they? EOS oh EOS and they’d
been there all morning. EOS marvellous, oh. EOS Oh dear. EOS oh EOS
Little things like that stick in your mind, don’t they? EOS Oh where
were your- where are you parents from, well mine are from the Lake
District. Both living in Windemere. Er back-to-back and never knew
each other. EOS real- EOS Because my father was four years older than
my mother. But they didn’t find out until of course they met up, after
his first wife died. EOS mm EOS And my- my mother was engaged to erm
a- a man who went out to Canada and lost all his money on the crash-
EOS Wall Street crash. EOS crash. EOS And said, ‘well I’ve got to
start again, I’ll send for you,’ EOS mm EOS and she said, ‘don’t
bother I’m not waiting.’ EOS And meanwhile her best friend who was my
father’s cousin, girl. Erm just asked her if she’d like to co- go out,
as a foursome because EOS mm EOS my father had lost his wife EOS yeah
EOS and she wanted to cheer him up and that’s how I become- EOS mm EOS
th- that’s how I ended up sitting here talking today. EOS . EOS yes
EOS If they’d never got together I wouldn’t be here. EOS Well it’s
true isn’t it? EOS yes. EOS You know. EOS Yes oh life is strange isn’t
it? Mm EOS It is, because always wanted- he did his national service
and always wanted to stay in the army. EOS Oh did he? EOS Yes he loved
it. Absolutely loved it. EOS Oh so why didn’t he? EOS Because his
mother and father said, ‘if you stay in the army, that’s it you’ve no
mother and father.’ EOS You’re joking! EOS No erm-. EOS What was the
reason? EOS Because- well they thought it was erm a reflection on them
that he wanted to be away from home. EOS Oh. EOS But they never really
got on, he got on better with his father than his mother, EOS mm EOS
but then his father would say, ‘well if you’d stayed in the forces,
you would never have met Vivienne .’ EOS mm EOS mm EOS And he said,
‘well I’m sure we would have done,’ EOS mm EOS ‘because we were meant
to be together.’ EOS mm EOS So it’s funny how things work out, isn’t
it? EOS Yes. Yes, was he an only one? EOS Oh yes. EOS Oh EOS oh yes.
EOS With a terrible mother. EOS really? EOS Really? EOS Oh she was- .
EOS Possessive? Controlling? EOS Yes and yet she was in a way
possessive, and yet she hadn’t got a lot of time for him. So I could
never weigh it all up. Nothing ever made sense. EOS mm EOS Erm and his
father was away a lot on business. You know and if he did anything
wrong, ‘wait ‘til your father comes home!’ EOS mm EOS And one
incident, he’d been smoking when he was about ten or eleven, with a
friend. Friend had a- parents had a pub and they went on the flat roof
and he was so ill. And of course his mother, ‘wait ‘til your father
comes home!’ and then when his father came home told him, ‘aren’t you
going to give him a good hiding?’ So he said, ‘he’s learnt his
lesson.’ EOS Mm. EOS mm EOS yeah EOS And he never really smoked
cigarettes again. Occasionally, EOS mmhmm EOS if lit up he’d say, ‘ooh
I just fancy one,’ and he’d have one. EOS mm EOS But he never went out
and bought a packet of cigarettes. EOS Mm, my parents didn’t smoke.
But my brother did, me half-brother did. And my half sister. EOS mm,
no me dad smoked but me mum couldn’t stand it. EOS No, no. EOS
Couldn’t stand it. I’ve never smoked. EOS No, no I haven’t. EOS has
smoked but gave it up some years ago. EOS mmhmm EOS Erm has the odd
one, more a social- EOS mm EOS doesn’t sit at home smoking. EOS mm EOS
doesn’t smoke, doesn’t smoke. EOS No. EOS Erm-. EOS mm, and actually
my parents were tee-total. EOS Were they? EOS Until my father got to
eighty and then he used to have his brandy in a morning, to keep his
heart going he used to say. EOS Well they used to say a drop of
whiskey at night is good for you. EOS Well yes, they did. Yes, yes,
but erm EOS That’s my excuse if I have one. EOS It’s good for me! EOS
Oh but erm, EOS cos you read all these things in the paper, EOS yes,
yes EOS you know and glass of red wine. EOS Well it’s beer today,
apparently. EOS I know that was in the paper the other day. EOS
Giving- yeah keeping your heart going. EOS Don’t like beer. EOS I
think I’ll do without, mm, mm EOS Don’t like beer at all. No. EOS What
are local people like? The people where I live- well they’re all very
nice really, it’s quite quiet, but it’s a- it’s such a good area, I
mean the house is up for sale, I can’t imagine why nobody buys it. EOS
mm EOS Because it’s such a super spot to be, EOS mm EOS you’ve got the
railway, you’ve got-. EOS mm, everything’s to hand isn’t it, yes EOS
Everything’s at hand, you’ve got sports centres, you’ve got swimming
pools, golf courses. EOS mm EOS You can get into Manchester so
quickly, and you can get onto the M- sixty- sixty two, sixty-one,
fifty six, in ten minutes. EOS mm, I think you’re better placed than I
am, in Irlam, EOS yes EOS because the buses are about- they’re
supposed to be every ten minutes but they’re not EOS mm EOS and
there’s only really one into Manchester. EOS mm EOS And there’s
another one that goes through Manchester into the Trafford centre, or
the Trafford centre into Manchester. And they’re about the only two.
EOS Yes and the- the thing about the Trafford centre is- it- I didn’t
like it when it was first built, EOS mm EOS I thought it would kill
off all the sho- local shops, which it did. EOS mm EOS But I do enjoy
going and I go at least twice a week. EOS mm EOS And I don’t
particularly buy erm, but I c- EOS if I want to, everything’s there.
EOS You can, yeah, yeah EOS I’ll just go because it’s very nice inside
and you can have a nice coffee and a cake on a morning. EOS In John
Lewis, yes, mm EOS Yes. And er- and I do quite enjoy going and it’s
just so quick to get there and to park and-. EOS It is, it’s no
problem. EOS It’s just no problem, so that’s a great advantage to this
area to me. EOS mm EOS yes EOS I’ve never been into Manchester for
years and I don’t think I ever will really. I’ve got- There’s nothing
there for me. EOS Well I go into Manchester erm, normally every
Thursday to meet two friends I used to work with many years ago at
ICI. EOS Oh right. Yes, yes EOS And then I meet another friend every
other week on a Wednesday, EOS mm, right EOS that I used to work with
at ICI. EOS mmhmm EOS So but normally I park in Marks and Spencers and
then on a Thursday have lunch in Marks, just a sandwich. One friend
moans the whole of the time EOS mm, mm EOS about the quality and the
standard and the noise, cos it is noisy in Marks and Spencers. EOS mm
EOS Oh right. EOS Now if that particular friend doesn’t come, er and I
will go to , EOS mm EOS which is erm an Austrian patisserie. EOS ooh
EOS Ooh you should see the cakes! EOS Mm, very nice. EOS Oh lovely.
Erm then when I go with we go to the . Where you can have a three
course lunch for six pounds fifty. EOS ahh EOS That’s good. EOS Yeah.
EOS mm EOS And I might walk through the Arndale centre EOS mm EOS erm,
couple of times recently I have had a bit of a walk round the Arndale
but I’ve been looking for specific shops. EOS mm EOS And there
everything seems that little bit bigger EOS mm EOS than in the
Trafford centre. EOS Trafford centre, yes. EOS And on Sunday, and I
and we’d taken back to w- erm the station, erm we went into EOS the
Arndale and I think- I can’t remember what we were looking for. But I
was surprised, it was a Sunday and I was able to park in Marks and
Spencers car park. EOS Oh right. EOS It’s not cheap, parking in- EOS
mm EOS and it does add- EOS mm EOS it adds to me lunch when I go. I
used to go on the bus. EOS mm, yes. EOS But you get on the bus and
then there’s these girls that get on with their buggies, EOS mm, mm
EOS mm EOS dripping in cheap jewellery, EOS not a ring in sight, and
oh. If smoking was allowed they’d be smoking. EOS mm. EOS mm EOS I’m
not a snob EOS no EOS but you know, you do have certain standards
don’t you? EOS I think it’s the way we were brought up Maureen ,
respect. EOS Probably. EOS In those days. EOS Yeah. Yes probably. EOS
You respected your teachers and- EOS mm EOS and we went to church and
Sunday school, didn’t we? EOS Yes we did. We certainly did. EOS And
then the pictures after church on a Sunday night sometimes, the
Palladium. EOS Terribly naughty. EOS When you think about it. EOS mm,
yes we used to go on to the pictures after we’d been to church. EOS
mm. And we’d done our duty, hadn’t we? EOS we’d been to church. EOS
Well, definitely! Yes those were the days. EOS Happy days. EOS But I
think, I remember it being more difficult for food, clothes and
everything else after nineteen forty five. Because that’s when it was
really difficult, when they put bread on rationing. That was awful.
EOS Yes because rationing went on for quite some time, didn’t it? EOS
It went to about fifty two I think. EOS Yes it went on for some time.
EOS But it went worse- I don’t think we probably got the help from
America that we’d had during the war. EOS Or thought we were going to
get. EOS Yes. EOS That’s right. EOS yeah I think so, mm. EOS Because
there was the air base in Warrington wasn’t there? Burtonwood EOS Yes.
The Americans, mm. EOS erm and I know a friend of my auntie’s went out
with one of the airmen EOS mm EOS and er- he used to take to erm ,
girlfriend, loads of sweets and things. EOS Yeah. EOS mm EOS So you
know we had sweets. EOS Yes. EOS in that way. EOS Yes. EOS But it was
a long time before things were really back to normal. EOS Anything
like- well, above- above the counter. EOS That’s right EOS And on
show, everything was under the counter. EOS yeah. EOS Nothing was on
show. No food was on show. EOS And I know we had a chicken nearly ever
week and it was a friend of my granddad’s and me dad’s, used to get
these live chickens EOS mm EOS and they were in Pendleton, and I had
to go on the bus and bring back this chicken. EOS Dead chicken, was it
plucked? EOS Alive Maureen ! EOS Oh you didn’t! EOS I did. EOS And I’d
no choice, I had to do it. EOS How did you carry it? EOS It used to be
in a bag, and EOS I’d be sitting on the bus, terrified in case it made
a noise. EOS Our would say that he did it, but if he did it, I don’t
remember. It was me, because I was the eldest. EOS He might have come
on the odd occasion to keep me company. EOS mm EOS But in the main, it
was me. So we always had-. EOS Can I ask you, EOS chicken EOS did you
eat any of it when you got home? EOS Oh once me mum had killed it and
cleaned it and everything. EOS And prepared it, oh EOS And it- mainly
boiling **inc**. EOS yes, yes EOS And she used to make beautiful
chicken soup. EOS yes EOS And erm our always had the best of the
chicken. And me mum would hide it under his rice, so that and I
couldn’t see it. EOS Really? Oh that’s not right at all is it? EOS But
that’s how it was, he got the best. EOS It was, yes, he did. EOS And
er- I mean we laugh about it, EOS mm EOS and the thing is, although we
know that he was in a way favoured, it never, has never- EOS Any
animosity between you. EOS No. EOS mm EOS mm EOS There’s never been
any jealousy among us. EOS no. EOS Between the five of us, at all
really. EOS mm, mm, my mother lived on a farm, erm, and my grandfather
was a bailiff. EOS Oh yes. EOS Which was- it- you know he- he rented
and he worked for the farmer and it was in Warrington, cos he came
down all the way from the Lake District, how they got down I’ve no
idea. EOS No, no motorways. EOS But they always- no and they were on
this farm called , which is still there in- in Warrington, Daresbury
actually. EOS Yeah mm. EOS And my mother went to school at Daresbury
village. And erm she said that my father- my grandfather always had-
if they had an egg, they only got the top off the egg, EOS and gra-
and her father got the whole egg. EOS Cos he was the working- he was
working. EOS Yes, yes. EOS and he was providing. EOS mm, mm EOS And
she said there was ce- EOS there were- there were lots of vegetables,
and she said, ‘he never took anything that wasn’t his’. EOS no EOS And
she said, ‘we could’ve lived really well if he’d just- taken a few of
these veggies and brought them home.’ EOS Yeah, vegetables, mm EOS But
he never did. Never took anything that wasn’t theirs they were so
honest. EOS Wasn’t theirs. EOS Mm, then they went back of course, went
back to erm-. EOS The Lake District. EOS Yes went back to Ulverston,
mm EOS mm, I was looking at the Lake District on the telly the other
night, erm- did you watch it? EOS Yes, yes I did actually, I’d seen it
before. EOS Yes, I’ve seen it before but I watched it again. EOS Yes,
yes EOS Erm and I thought, ‘oh we did have some nice little **inc**
breaks up in the lake district.’ EOS Yes. My cousin that still lives
there, erm her grandson is erm- well his girlfriend, who lives on ,
which is the island that nobody’s- it’s private. EOS mmhmm, yes, in
the middle bit EOS Erm-. EOS I’ve often wondered if anybody lived
there. EOS yes, it’s a beautiful house EOS Is it, mm, mm EOS It’s the
that have got that. The people who had the insurance company,
insurance company. EOS mm, oh EOS And they bought the island and they
live there. And this is their daughter. And she swam the English
channel about two weeks ago. EOS Did she? EOS For charity, yes. EOS
She’s a st- I think she’s a student now, I- I th- - I’m not sure
whether- she’s got two grandsons, and I’m not sure whether this
particular grandson is the one that’s living locally in Manchester,
EOS oh EOS come down from the Lake District erm cos there are two of
them and I do get them confused and they’re both at university, or one
has finished. EOS mm, mm, yes, yeah. EOS But this girlfriend, yeah she
swam the English channel. Yes. EOS swam the channel. EOS Cos she- she
let me know the other week about it, yeah. EOS mm, what about hat
older lady swimming it? And kept going off course? EOS I know EOS Oh
did she, I’ve no- I didn’t see that. EOS Yeah and I’ve forgot- I’ve
forgotten how long it took her, EOS ooh EOS but she did it. But it
took her hours and hours. EOS The English Channel? EOS Hours and hours
and hours. EOS You’ve got the jellyfish problem with the English
Channel. EOS I know. EOS haven’t you, really? Mm, EOS yeah EOS Oh
gosh. EOS No it was nice, watching the Lake District, yes EOS Yes very
beautiful if it’s not raining. EOS Ooh, the very first time we went on
the Friday afternoon, it was raining so hard. EOS mm EOS ‘Oh what have
we done, why have we come?’ But then Saturday and Sunday it was
glorious. EOS mm, mm, beautiful, mm EOS Absolutely. EOS Mm, they’ve
had very bad weather this last winter. EOS Mm with the snow and
everything. EOS Yes a lot of- yes, yeah and rain. EOS I mean that’s
why I can’t understand the reservoirs being so low. EOS No but EOS
When we’ve had so much snow. EOS My cousin, when she was telling me
about these- this er grandson’s girlfriend. Erm she said, ‘oh you
wouldn’t believe how low they are.’ She said, ‘we’ve been out and
we’ve been looking and they’re extremely low.’ mm EOS I know when we
used to drive over to Harrogate erm on the M-sixty- two, we always
looked at one reservoir, Time EOS mm EOS ‘oh it’s a bit low this y-
this week.’ EOS mm EOS Do you know the one I mean? EOS Yeah, yeah I go
that way. EOS Yes and er we’d be sort of, ‘oh there’s going to be a
water shortage.’ EOS mm EOS mm EOS mm EOS our had to defy the hosepipe
ban before. EOS He what, sorry? EOS Had to defy the hosepipe ban.
Because our got all dog’s poo on his shoes. EOS oh, oh EOS And so he
had to swill them down. EOS Did he? I hope this is not being used in
evidence against him EOS for a thousand pounds. EOS I never thought
about that EOS Oh dear. EOS Confessions. EOS Confessions, yes. EOS mm,
well I mean, I use my hosepipe to fill my watering can and my gra- my
son-in-law said, ‘you can’t do that it’s illegal.’ I said, ‘rubbish.
It can’t be illegal.’ But I’ll tell you one thing. This hosepipe ban
is so ridiculous cos you waste more money- sorry more water. EOS More
water. EOS In a watering can. EOS yeah EOS Well I think so, Maureen
too. EOS Because you’re being- it’s pouring out and EOS yes EOS and if
it was coming out as a spray EOS a spray EOS and a shower, it would go
into the flowers and everything quicker. EOS Yes, yeah EOS But it’s
just going over the tops and- and going on the- one the road. On the
pavements. EOS I think it’s worse. EOS mm EOS I think it’s silly. EOS
Mm, I do. Yes, but still. EOS I can understand them saying the
hosepipe ban for washing cars at home. EOS Well at home but what about
these- EOS but you can still- EOS can you still take them to the-? EOS
Oh yes you can still take them to these places. EOS yeah EOS Places to
have them cleaned. Oh right, right. I didn’t realise that. EOS I mean
the gardeners that I have, said that he’d looked it up on the erm
internet EOS mmhmm EOS and it was so complicated, what you could, what
you couldn’t do, EOS oh yes, yes, EOS that in the end, he gave up. EOS
mm. EOS United utilities saying one thing, somebody else saying
something else, and he thought, ‘just don’t get it.’ EOS mmhmm, mm,
no. Well my- I’ve got one hanging basket, beautiful EOS mm EOS because
it’s rained on it and the other one is slightly under the porch EOS mm
EOS at the front door and it’s dead. EOS ahh EOS And never bothered
watering it. So I’ve had to get it down and just let the tap run on
it, EOS mm EOS so that’s wasted a lot of water. EOS Yeah, yeah, yeah.
EOS Today, whether it will revive, I don’t think it will. EOS mm, c-
It will, it will cos they said to me on Tuesday, I said, ‘I know what
you’re going to say,’ I said, ‘well you see it has rained so I thought
to myself ‘I don’t need to water them,’ EOS mm EOS ooh EOS But you
still need to water them, so-. EOS Oh gosh you do because it doesn’t
get through. EOS no EOS It only stays on the top. EOS yes EOS Hmm, how
are we doing?
