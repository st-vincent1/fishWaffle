you know I like sports. No problem at all with sports. You know you do
the sack race and egg-spoon race and all this kind of thing you know.
It says here did you ever get you ever get into trouble at school? No
I didn’t. No you didn’t . No I didn’t. Did you Edmund **anon**? Not
really no. See I- I- I started school at **anon**. Was only there a
year and me parents said it wasn’t suitable cos of me problem with me
speech. They used to hit me over the head with a ruler to get the
words out and it made you wo- And then I went to **anon**. I don’t
know if you’ve ever heard of EOS it’s a- I loved it there. There was
two ladies that’s all who taught you. I didn’t like school with having
the problem with speech. It was- you know- but erm I went and as soon
as I- I was fourteen I EOS I just didn’t like it. So did I get into
trouble? No I don’t think I did. The only t- I- yeah I got six of the
best once. Well I used to write d- I used to go to s- erm the school
that **anon** and there’s always a bully- and I was riding me bike
back to school and he stopped me and he made me give him a lift on my
crossbar. And when I got to school- oh I got stopped- we got stopped
on the way there by a policeman. ‘Which school do you go to?’ So I
told him and the middle of the afternoon I was in the headmaster’s
office and I got six of the best. Caned for doing that. And lookayat
the world today. Just with having someone on- on your bike. On your
crossbar. Well I left school- I think I left school when I was six- I
think I was sixteen when I left s- when I left school, I- Mm. I- I
liked me childhood days yes because I was l- lucky that our house was
only about the- a couple of hundred yards off a farm. oh, that’s nice
EOS And I was always on there and I love animals. And me favourite
animal’s the cow. It’s so laid back and- just like that the cow you
know. So I spent a- a lot of my- my time with animals on- on the farm
you know. Yeah, that’s nice EOS I once- yeah I was still at school and
there was a c- c- couple of farms not- short distance. And the farmer
asked me to go to the other farm and erm excuse me. I was walking it
and there’s some ditches where all the water drains in- and there was
a man on a bike acting suspicious. So I- I watched him and then I went
on and I caught a butterfly in me EOS He cycled up to me then and said
‘what have you got in your hand?’ I said ‘a butterfly’ He said erm,
‘let it go! You don’t know what it’s like t- to be fastened up’. So I
did and erm I went to the other farm and walking back I went to have a
lookayin this ditch. And I found erm clothes, prison clothes . It was
an escaped prisoner. So I left them and I went to the police station
in Urmston and they said ‘have a lookayat will you at this bookayand
see if you can find him’. And I found him and they gave me five
shillings. Oh five shillings oh. S- so erm I can u- understand the
story now with the butterfly and EOS S- so that was on- one of my
school stories anyway and erm I suppose there’s a lot isn’t there
really. But it wasn’t bad. I enjoyed me school i- in a way. And erm
and I’m a great believer your life’s mapped out EOS because on the
piece of land I live now I lived in nineteen thirty. But this is a
modern house now and there was an old house on there. And I didn’t
know when I bought this house exactly where I’d lived. So I do believe
y- your life in a way your pattern of life is led. You know because
I’m going to end up where I started off you know EOS Mm. Have you got
any more Fearne **anon** then them that you’ve thought EOS Well
there’s one here one at the top. W- where are your parents from? Now
that’s an question because erm I got an old photograph at EOS Very old
photograph. Erm when me mother was alive- she lived w- we moved away
from **anon** up to- moved up to **anon**. She was alive then- but I
didn’t knew me father at all. No. So- so I don’t know about that one
but erm I mean me uncles and all that me aunties are you know passed
away. So it’s- Yeah, yeah, yeah. So- so it just that, erm, w- Is your
mother from L- Lancashire or out of the county? Erm sh- sh- she could-
she could be. I mean you know. mm, you don’t really know. We don’t
really know. You know you’re so young you sometimes you EOS Do you
know what happened in those days? They would never tell you EOS Your
parents. They kept s- secret. I erm- when I was five I went to my
Grandma’s funeral in **anon**. And you weren’t allowed to see anything
so I- I was taken for a walk in the village. It was a lovely village.
There was a stream and it was a beautiful village and I was only five.
And all me life I had this picture of this village and whenever I
asked my parents what it was called ‘what do you want to know for?’
And I must’ve been about seventy and we had a motorhome then. And I
said to my wife ‘come on. I’m going to find- the name of this
village’. I knew where one of the ancestors lived and we went into
this erm village and they said ‘oh you’d better ask at the postoffice
he’ll know’. So we went in the postoffice, says ‘I can’t help you.
I’ve only been here two weeks’. So he didn’t know any of the
villagers. So an- anyway in the end we did find a person of the
surname that we were looking for. So we went round to this house and
as we- and I said to me wife ‘get out and ask this lady walking down
the path if they know a **anon**’. So she got out and this lady says
‘come on in it’s me mother’. Yeah. And she told me the name of the
village. So after about seventy years I went back and it still looked
the same to me. But they had secrets they wouldn’t tell you. ‘W- what
do you want to know for?’ And erm- Yeah, yeah, yeah EOS So I’m half
Lancashire and half Yorkshire. Mother’s from Yorkshire. Near **anon**.
And me dad’s from **anon** and he was a joiner. Erm me- m- mother w-
worked in service. What was called service in those days. She more or
less lived in the house and was responsible for the house. Looking
after it. Cleaning it, meals, everything you know EOS and in those
days it was called service. And she worked in **anon** EOS Erm not
much about school is there at the moment? No, no erm EOS it’s just
that I’m looking at this other one here, the local evening news
stories about thi- important people know about your- your town. Well
as I said before in **anon** I meant to t- I meant to tell you this
but I got two sisters which I never seen. very long- for a very long
time. I’ve got their address and I gave it to me brother to- you know
to get in touch you know with us but I don’t know if he’s done it yet.
I don’t know. Sometimes- I usually go down to see him but he meets me
so, cos it’s a long way. c- cos he’s moved into a bungalow now you
see. He’s not- he’s never been married you know, he’s- Well I’m not
asking how old you are Fearne **anon** but - No. I’m not that bothered
about my age. Were you at school in the war or- or af- or after? I’ll
be- I was born in nineteen forty one so I’ll be- Oh you missed it.
Well no you were born in the war. born in the war yeah. mm, mm, mm EOS
So I’ve got an old big photograph you know erm at home somewhere but
EOS I remember I used to have this old three wheeled bike. Very old
three EOS Mm oh yeah. Yeah. A very old one you know. In **anon**, very
old. And the people w- w- when we put our house up for sale EOS and a
nice couple b- bought it. You know nice coloured people bought it you
know EOS So that’s when we moved for my mother’s health you know. So
she couldn’t travel. She couldn’t go out at all much. Well the war
started didn’t it in nineteen thirty nine. Yeah, yeah so- And I was at
**anon** school then- which overlooked the canal. Oh the boats that
went along there they were fabulous you know it’s- you don’t see them
now. They’ve all gone. Massive big boats with a- a- a tug a- at the
front to pull it. T- t- tug at the back to steady it back you know-
and the bridge used to swing EOS and that was good there th- for a- w-
watching that you know. So I- I was at school when the war started and
erm it was a queer time because all the street signs were moved. All
the lights were taken awa- no lights were allowed to be on. All the
cars had to have a light with a slit in it only. It was a- a weird
place didn’t it. All the names went didn’t they. They were taken away
and- and where I lived in **anon** there was a barrage balloon site on
the corner. And the barrage balloon was- it was f- f- filled with gas
and when the airraid came it used to go into the air to stop aircraft
d- diving down. Because we lived a short distance from **anon**- which
was erm industry in the war. And erm- and when the wind was- if the
barrage balloon went up and it was windy the ba- the barrage balloon
used to sway into our- our back garden you know and erm yeah. You just
were frightened to death you know and they erm and leading to **anon**
was big oil drums on the side of the road- with a out. And the Germans
used to follow the ship c- canal from L- Liverpool- when the- the
moonlight was out you can be sure there’s going to be a raid you know.
And you used to f- f- follow the moon No left channel EOS up the canal
and if the wind was blowing to Trafford Park they used to light these
oil drums so a mass of smoke went over the park and they couldn’t find
it. Yeah. So erm- I think I’ve lived in the best time cos radio was
still new. T- television had been thought of but it had been put on
one side because of the war. Buses were always on time. Weren’t they
Fearne **anon**? If you went out for a bus- It’d be there EOS it was
there. And you can erm- it was you know. Now what are the most
important changes in- in a- in your town? Well it’s changed- we have
no cinemas left. No. No we haven’t. There’s- that big one in Sale-
that’s just standing there. I know- I used to go there one time. But
it’s just standing there doing nothing you know. Sh- sh- it’s a shame
really you know. They’ve gone because my youth I used to go to the
cinema about twice EOS And when I got a little bit older, do you
remember Urmston baths? Not the old one. Not the old one. I know the
new one. **anon** talks about- cos it used to be the **anon** EOS Well
the Urmston baths in the winter. They used to empty the water EOS put
a wooden floor over it. And it was sprung like a proper dance floor
and they had dancing every Saturday and Wednesday. And they had a big
bands. About a fifteen piece band that came every EOS That was fun.
And you daren’t drink cos if you’d had a drink a girl wouldn’t dance
EOS It was very strict in those days. So yeah U- Urmston’s v- very
busy now. Whereas I can- one- one memory I’ve got in the school days
when the war started was me mother pushing the pram with my sister in-
down to Urmston a blackout c- c- curtaining you know. Cos we had
orders. We hadn’t got to sh- sh- show any lights at all and- you had
to have your windows blacked out so nobody could see and that is one
of the memories I’ve got. And then the bombs dropping round you. It
was a bit of a hectic time wasn’t it. those- those days, yeah EOS You
never got a night in bed- without you were i- in- in a- a air raid sh-
shelter. Yeah that’s right they’d shelters didn’t they. Yeah. No.
Ours- ours was in the house. There was an Anderson shelter- you’ve-
have you heard of an Anderson? I’m not quite sure if I have heard of
it. It’s all cast- and it’s all iron metal. With four sides and a
metal top. So if the bomb- house fell on it it wouldn’t- you’d be safe
inside there you know. We had a wired mesh all around it like an-
animals . And that was called- and that was inside ours. The Anderson
shelter. We had one outside our house. In our old house. It had like
pebbles over it so it looked like it was just part of the EOS Yeah so
it looked like a part of the garden. Yeah. I never- we couldn’t get
into it cos it was all blocked off inside. But at least I found .
Yeah, yeah. Yeah th- they were scary days weren’t they in a way EOS Mm
it was yeah. You know cos you didn’t know what’s going to happen. I
mean I was only v- I must’ve been very young- to you know. It’s erm-
Well as I said I didn’t like school. Did you move house at all when
you were young? What memories do you have of this? I moved house once.
I moved from where I live now to **anon** another part of **anon**
where me p- parents stayed until they p- passed away so- so they were
there a long time. I- I- I lived there ‘til I was twenty five. Cos
there was a lot going on in Urmston then. I went- with being
stammering I was very shy and reserved and I thought I’ve got to do
summat about this. So I went and had d- d- d- d- dancing lessons in
Urmston. Yeah and I enjoyed it and I’ve got all my medals for dancing
. Yeah and that was a way of b- bringing me out you know EOS Yeah. Mm.
And then course you were always g- going dancing and m- we had a milk
bar in Urmston. Did you- did you have a milk bar at all **anon**? If I
could remember it’s- They only sold milkshakes. Mm. S- sh- shop’s
still there now but they’ve run out of milk. It’s EOS Yeah. I tell you
what I was thinking of last night. I knew what I wanted to do when I
left school and as soon as I was fourteen I was EOS And I wanted to be
a lithographic printer. I was always interested in printing all- this
was nineteen forty four. There was one year left of the war. But it
was ending and there were soldiers were arriving home then. So they
had to have their old jobs back. You c- I c- could not get a job EOS
to be a lithographic printer. So- I’m talking a lot aren’t I. No you
ca- no you carry on you carry on! So there was an advert in the
newspaper. The evening news. ‘Boy wanted to learn lithographic
printing’ Manchester. So I was there for eight o’clock and the job had
gone. Dear me. Anyway so they said ‘but we’ve got a vacancy in the
handwritten department’. Now don’t ask me what that was. So they- I
went along with them upstairs and they showed me. There was about nine
men working there all doing handwritten posters- which they did in
those days. I mean I can r- r- remember Urmston it was just full of
posters on the walls. Most of those were hand done. All- o- others
were lithographic printed so I started there. And erm to cut a long
story short I did that the rest of my life for fifty EOS But when I
worked there got a pound a week. And I’ve written this down because
I’d forget it wouldn’t I EOS You came prepared . I had to go on the
bus to Manchester six days a week. That cost me fifty four d, old p-
pence a week. I had to give me m- mother ninety p oh no d, of the old
money. I used to go to the pictures twice a week for th- th- thirty d.
Thirty pence. Thirty eight old money and I was left with sixty six p-
for a week and that was a pound. And I used to live on it EOS and I
think now. I think that’s now why it’s made me appreciate- the value
of money. And erm if I can jump a bit further I then left there and
went to work for another firm who did, you won’t have heard of these
will you- You’ll have heard of them won’t you? Oh yes, yeah, yeah.
Well the **anon** were the biggest circuit in England of cinemas. And
some cinemas used to change three times a week. Monday Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday Friday Saturday and a different one on a Sunday-
so people went. And there was about- I think there was sixty of us
worked there. And we used to do abou- I- I forget the amount but it
was in hundreds. The circuit was in hundreds of cinemas. And we used
to do them all by hand every week. One week’s holiday. A forty eight
hour week and that’s where I really learnt me job there you know my
trade. They went bankrupt. And I got oth- other jobs you know and then
I always wanted to have me own business and I started my own business
in nineteen sixty six . I found this old property and I started in
business on two weeks holiday pay that I’d got from the firm. Fifteen-
thirty pound it was for two weeks. Out of that I had to pay sixteen
pound to rent the shop. It was a big gamble wasn’t it. But I was lucky
that I got the c- custom you know. Struggled and erm- but people were
good in those days c- anyway I- I managed to get- make friends with a
chappy who worked for I think it was Esso petroleum. And he- he was
responsible for ad- advertising and he used to bring me the
advertising to do you know big wooden signs. And so I hadn’t erm money
to buy the wood even to do them on. But there was a wonderful sh- shop
in **anon** where th- you know they used to sell wood. And he said to
me ‘Edmund **anon** you take it. When you get paid you pay me’ and I
thought that was lovely that. You know. And I worked on my own for t-
twenty five years and enjoyed it. Erm and I lookayback on life it’s-
it’s had its bad times I’ve EOS First time okay, you can’t have it
perfect can you. And then me wife- I went out with me wife once when I
was about eighteen and the problem was she was a friend of the fam- or
their- her parents were a friend of my parents and whenever she came
round I went out you know. So anyway we went out with each other once.
We didn’t like each other EOS We went off an married somebody else and
fifteen years later I got divorced. D- didn’t know where **anon** was.
Hadn’t the slightest where she was. Until a friend of mine who was an
insurance agent he said ‘I’ve just knocked at a house in Stretford and
this **anon**- **anon** came to the door.’ I said ‘did she?’ He said
‘yeah’ he said erm ‘she’s got divorced and she’s living in **anon**
and she’s a bit of alright yeah Edmund **anon**’ Left channel resumes
EOS So Edmund **anon** wrote to her mother EOS And that’s how that
started all over again. So you can see why I believe your life’s
mapped out. Cos how did I meet her again in **anon** when I was here?
And both divorced and things. Yeah this is it you know. And that- that
was fantastic that. I’ve got a boy off me first marriage and off the
second I’ve got t- two girls EOS One’s okay One’s very okay, one’s
lovely. And the other one sh- she was even odd with her mother you
know. I haven’t heard off her for a year now. I mean her mum died th-
th- th- what three year ago now wouldn’t it be. Yeah. And erm sh-
she’s strange. Course there’s always strange ones about. P- people say
I’m strange. No left channel EOS Well when I left school- when I left
school I would I did erm I work in **anon**- in a factory but erm I
was a- I was a cleaner there. Cleaner. You know full time cleaner. Oh
yeah, yeah. I’ve not just do- I’ve always done cleaning. Who do you
work for? I might know them. Erm well it’s called **anon**- **anon**.
It’s not- they’re not there an- But the building’s still there. Yeah.
No I don’t remember them. Erm the- it- quite a few got made redundant.
I couldn’t tell you how many years that was. But I was made redundant.
And then I worked in the erm- in the canteen you know. I’ve done EOS
I’ve done looking after children- And erm as you know I look after
dogs and all this kind of thing. Yeah of course. Yeah yeah. Mm. You
know erm hal- in the fact the people I’ve just c- come back from EOS
Erm it was me last night last night cos they came- They came back did
they? Yeah. back yesterday afternoon about half past two. Yeah. They
were very pleased everything was okay you know. Cos they know. I’ve
been with them what it must be about twenty one years I’ve been with
them you know cos they know they can trust me EOS Mm, mm, that’s
right. you know. They know the two cats are being getting looked
after. That’s the most important thing in life isn’t it trust. Trust
t- trust you know. You know. If they trust you. I’ve got a lady who
does my house work and I come out many a day and she lets herself in
and I’ve got a lot of f- faith in and trust in her and it’s nice to
have- cos that’s important part of life is trust. Isn’t it? I you
don’t mind if I chatter? No you carry on EOS . It’s what he’s good at
EOS He is isn’t he carry on. In ninetee- with having me own business-
in nineteen seventy four I was invited to join the Rotary Club
**anon**. Have you heard of Rotary? No. You’ll- you might’ve heard of
Rotary. I might’ve heard of it. Long time ago . They used to come
round the streets at C- Christmas time with a Christmas float. Yours
in **anon**- Yeah they used to do it- they used- and Lymm- Lymm- Lymm
R- Rotary Club came round. And it- it was- it was started in America
originally. And it’s for business men you know who’ve reached the top
of the EOS Well I couldn’t go any higher cos I worked myself. You see.
So- I was invited to join you know. And that was good. And that gave
me a lot of confidence- because they have to stand up and s- give a
talk once a year. And I was still very bad stammering. And erm when it
was my t- turn the first time they said ‘Edmund **anon** you don’t
have to do it if you don’t want’. I said I’m going to make them have
it you know. But I did it okay because they’re all on your side.
That’s the best part of it. So I w- I was in t- twenty one years in
Rotary. I was ch- chairman of the community section which looked after
the area you know and I loved- I like local charity work- Mm. Yeah.
Yeah. and looking after the area where I know. And whenever it was my
turn to speak th- the president would announce it the week before that
next weeks speaker is Edmund Jacobs **anon**- and we’re extending the
lunch half an hour EOS But all that helped you. And do you know what I
ended up there doing? I was speaker’s EOS And yeah. Now that was a
good p- part of my life. An- and the wife was in- i- in the ladies
section. I was invited every year to be president but because you had
to visit other clubs I’ve turned it down. But my wife acc- c- cepted
the ladies side of it. so I used to go out for free meals with her
then. So tha- that was it. Yeah but in those days Rotary was nearly
consisted of- doctors, surgeons, solicitors. All local people. All the
shops in Urmston were owned b- by the actual owner. They were
privately owned. And they were all members of the Rotary Club. But
there’s none left EOS You’ve got the dentist. You’ve got them all
sorts of- all walks of life as a member. And erm but it’s gone now.
You can’t walk into any shop without its being a big c- concern. I
mean there’s not a- a lot of these shops like **anon** left EOS where
you can s- s- see the owner. They’ve gone. That’s the personal touch
that’s gone. Yeah you’re right. Because I was- a lady I rented me shop
off she said to me cos her’s was a- next door she says ‘let me give
you a bit of advice. Get a good EOS and never lose the personal
touch’. And you’re always there to- That’s the thing with the chain
stores isn’t it. Well it is yeah. They don’t have the personal touches
and- It’s sad that isn’t it you know. And like I said earlier on the
buses were always on time. I mean I had to be at work for eight
o’clock . Excuse me. And if I missed the twenty five past seven there
was one at half past. And if I missed the half past there was one at
twenty five to. And the twenty five to just got me there. You know.
But there wasn’t as m- many p- people on the roads then- so the b-
buses weren’t held up. Erm have you got anything else for a- a minute?
Well I’m on this- what do local people like? What do the local people
like? Well where I- where I live in **anon** I’ve got- I’ve got good
EOS You know. Erm I mean at the back there’s no houses it’s just
fields EOS I do have good erm some people- Well I’ve noticed that now.
Yeah very ni- Now I’m you know on- on my own. Everybody knows me. I
know them. bet you chat to them all EOS And erm- and a- a lady
opposite with her husband you know. And when I go out at all in the
evening which is not- I don’t like to go out now. It’s not safe for-
older people to go out and that’s one of the sad things of life which
I’ll go back to in a minute that. It’s reminded me of something. Erm
I’ve got to let this lady know I’m going out and w- when I’ll be back.
Which is good. So she can keep an eye on you. It’s to keep an eye on
me cos she knows if- if I don’t get up in the morning something’s
happened don’t they. You know what they used to like Fearne **anon**?
Christmas time. Go into Manchester looking at **anon** arcade. Oh
**anon** aye. When it was Christmas it- **anon** had long windows down
the side of an EOS The other side of the arcade was **anon** and erm
every window was decorated at Christmas with animation and animals and
moving and there was a real spirit of Christmas. And people used to go
down especially just to look in the windows when it was closed. Now I
came to Urmston on Sunday and I drove th- th- through Urmston- excuse
me and nearly every window was shuttered. Metal shutters. Well in my
youth you could walk and look in all the EOS Enjoy yourself. Nowhere
was open EOS but today it’s all ‘keep out’ shutters- Keep it. Yeah.
Keep out, yeah EOS you know. We don’t want you and all like that and-
No, yeah, yeah. And I saw s- something the other day that disgusted me
really. House for sale sign and they’ve got to s- s- set them alight
these days. Well what do they get out of it? This is it- W- w- what do
you get out of damaging anything? Mm. It’s the same you know a car’s
been stolen. They burn it don’t EOS Many times in **anon**- they’re
forced to put these new railings up at that big school. Many time- I-
and we used to go in there and we used to look after the dogs. And
they used to take the dogs in there. I kept them on the lead cos they
weren’t my dogs. And erm I used to take you know a doggy bag with me.
Anyway you always see- every now and again you see cars been burned.
Oh yeah, yeah. And I f- I feel sorry for the person. The person yeah.
You know. Find out one morning the car’s not there. Yeah. You can’t- I
can’t understand- I- I can’t understand why they can’t- why they do
this kind of thing. Did you want to ask us any questions? Are w- are
w- are we running out of time? Erm you’ve got t- ten minutes. My g-
my- Can I just say? Erm my wife and I we- a lot of people don’t like
EOS I had one and I used to hold people up on the road. You know. we
did about th- th- thirty years you know. But when I- I- I retired my
s- we’ll go up into a motorhome which was as fast as a car could go.
And I’ve been all over England, Scotland and Wales and our hobby when
I r- retired was adopting the old guide dogs. Oh yeah I . Oh I loved
doing that and I’ve got five dogs’ ashes in the back EOS And I’m an
emotional person and the first dog we adopted w- was- the owner was
blind and deaf. Yeah blind and deaf. So he had to be with a g- guide
dog but he couldn’t hear as well. God that must be difficult. So that
was difficult. So the pers- so w- got her you know y- y- you’re
interviewed at home to see if you’re suitable. And w- when you get the
dog they come back in a fortnight to make sure that you’re- the dogs
are settled. And we- oh we went to this dog called Honey. And the day
before we got a phone call from the guide dogs. He says ‘I hope you
don’t mind he wants to meet you’. I said ‘no I don’t mind’ you know.
And erm- so we went down and we met him. M- m- my wife sat beside him
and questions were asked and if it meant just a yes or a- a no answer-
my wife had to either t- t- t- tap his hand for yes. I forget which
way round or- rub it for no you know. And anyway the- he had a- like
a- a machine tha- a braille machine. And the guide dog people used to
t- t- type the message in and he picked it up. So that- but he must’ve
gone deaf later in life cos he could still EOS So he could talk to us,
anyhow, after half an hour he’d- he’d handed over the- the- the lead
to my wife. He’d handed over the dog’s tablets. He had his other dog
there- but he was handing over his eyes and his ears. And after half
an hour they said to me ‘Mr Jacobs **anon** will you t- t- take the
dog’s lead and go’. Well I got outside there and I thought I’ve taken
his eyes and ears away and I cried my eyes out. and they had to take
me for a cup of tea you know. It’s- it’s a traumatic situation- Yeah.
I’ve- I’ve done a lot of erm- I do a lot of charity work for- for
animals you know. Oh okay Yeah. And I- you know you had coppers I’d
save them in a carrier bag. Sainsbury’s carrier bag and I take them
down to erm Sale. the, you know, for sick animals. That’s what I did
because I love animals you know. I don’t like to see people to be
cruel you know. Oh no no. Well I seen a greyhound near- in Partington-
I don’t know who it belongs to but it had a- like a- one of these
white collars you know. Oh yeah. Yeah. I don’t know if it had escaped
from a greyhound thing or what. Mm somebody owned it yeah. Or- it came
up to me friendly. I was watching these- these lads you know. They’re
always drinking frigging beer. Wha- you know. Yeah oh I know. Yeah mm.
I didn- I saw this- this chap ‘go away, go a- away’. And I thought
leave him alone. Poor thing’s not doing any harm. Yeah of course he’s
not hurting anyone. And I took some biscuits out with me last night.
and he wasn’t there. No so I don’t know who- who owns it. But it’s a-
it’s a shame you EOS Well, when- when we had ordinary dogs you know
pet dogs before we started to adopt- Oh that’s right. We got to the
end of the- I- with the guide dogs. I was saying I don’t think I can
have another because of walking them. So the vet came out with the
dogs. He says ‘this dogs are l- these dogs are lovely to walk’. T-
twenty minutes a day and they spent the rest of the time by the fire.
And that was a greyhound. So erm anyway I- I never got round to it
because me doggy died and then me wife died. And on your own you can’t
look after a dog. But just going back to life. Fearne **anon** and
myself go to church. Now whether that’s made us any better people I
don’t know. Well it does with me because I mean I do believe. You
know. I’m- I am a Christian and I do believe. And I do a lot for
**anon** church in **anon**. And I help out with the Sunday School as
well you see- with the children. The lady what’s been doing it for a-
a- well her EOS She’d been doing it for a long time. She does all the
work you know EOS And I just go in with her to help her you know.
that’s what I’m going to do as well. I enjoyed ch- church. Really
enjoyed it. Been all me life cos I was first introduced when I was
five. With going to a church school. And then a church school. And
then I was in the best youth club of all which was a church and then I
moved away from the church w- when I got married first time. Never
went back. And I’ve been a very active member involved in doing
everything. And enjoyed it. Now I won’t mention any names or where I’m
going but this vicar doesn’t get the best out of me. Yeah, and it’s
sad that. And he knows it. He’s a nice chap. Great with my wife when
she was EOS I mean, he said to us m- me daughter ‘any time night or
day you want me call me’. Well me wife died at home. Five o clock in
the mor- morning. I was lucky that night that I had erm a nurse f-
from **anon** who was EOS Cos I wouldn’t have known what to do on me
own properly. So I rang me daughter up. She came and she said ‘I’m
going to ring EOS And he was w- with us within half an hour. So he-
he- he was good on that side. When you really needed him he was there
and I think being a church m- member has helped me a lot in life. I-
I’m very honest. I’m very sincere. I talk a lot. I l- I like to listen
to you you know. I like to listen to you EOS I’ve got hundreds of
stories that I can’t- But is it- an- nearly up yet?
