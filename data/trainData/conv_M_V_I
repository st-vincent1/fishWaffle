that school and I got the EOS Oh I got the cane for it. EOS I was
late, I’ve never been late in my life, and I still hate being late for
anything. EOS And I dawdled on the way to school and suddenly I
realised that the doors were locked and I couldn’t get in. And I had
to stand waiting while they did the prayers. EOS How old were you
then? EOS Erm I was in the junior school, so possibly about eleven.
Ten or eleven. And I got the- this cane on my l- on my hand EOS who
gave you that? **anon**? EOS **anon** and it was- EOS He was a bit

it- and I was so mortified that I had to stand there in the hall and
be caned. Section omitted due to recording problem EOS Difficult years

the Germans would arrive on the doorstep. EOS Cos we had shelters

one of those, I remember, very, very hard in the EOS Somebody thumped
me, we never knew who it was. But er-. EOS Well you wouldn’t in the

a church school. EOS It was always a very good school. But as far as
favourite teacher Left channel resumes EOS Was there one called
**anon**? EOS I think she was a favourite. EOS Yes possibly, she came
from Irlam. EOS Mm, she did. EOS **anon** with the strap in the
corner. EOS She used to frighten me to death. But she was a very, very
good teacher. Was her name **anon**? EOS She used to play the piano.
EOS I don’t remember that name. EOS And if we didn’t sing- she taught
us ‘Jerusalem’ and if we didn’t sing it correctly, oh my word! She was
very strict. No right channel EOS right, right, I remember **anon**.
Now she was extremely strict. EOS Very strict lady. She was a large
lady and she was very, very strict, everyone was frightened of her.
EOS Well I think-. EOS As far as your first day at school, that
school- I actually, had been up in the lake district cos I’d been
evacuated erm to my aunt’s. And I do not remember really my first day
at school but I do remember at the infants. And I do remember you and
**anon** with your lovely dark black EOS that was cut you know, with
your fringes. I remember looking and thinking, ‘ooh what lovely hair!’
EOS I remember my first day. Cos I was five when I went. Right channel

picture the classroom. EOS And our **anon** younger than me, she cried

afterwards. No right channel EOS Oh, oh right. EOS Erm- but then our
**anon** had appendicitis M did she EOS and she was rushed to
hospital. EOS And she missed quite a bit of schooling because of it.
EOS ooh, cos it was a big operation. EOS It was in those days, yes.
Cos they were frightened it might be EOS Because **anon**, my dad’s
sister, she had died at fourteen EOS with peritonitis. Erm and we
always felt that she never quite caught up, because she missed-. EOS
The grounding, you know, the basics. She’s alright now but that’s the
way we felt. Right channel resumes EOS mm, mm, summer holidays for me
were again, back in the Lake District. EOS Erm I used to go on . EOS
We used to go on coach trips, Stratford upon Avon. EOS Erm I didn’t go
to Scarborough. Erm, round Wales. EOS Me dad used to take us to New
Brighton on the bus. EOS But that’s as far as it went in those days,
cos people didn’t go on holiday, did they really? EOS mm, no they
didn’t no. Well you couldn’t because there was no seaside to go to,
because it was mined, all the beaches. I do remember going to
Blackpool once. EOS Yes I remember Blackpool. EOS And it was all
barbed wire and you weren’t allowed on the beach to play. Erm I
presume it was all mined and you know, waiting for an EOS So beaches
were just you know-. EOS A no go area. EOS No go areas yes. Yes. EOS
But having said that, I mean- our school days- we never went short. We
were never short of food or anything like that. EOS No, it wasn’t very
good at times. EOS We made the most of what we had, erm EOS Yes and I
still hate celery. EOS I’ve never really taken to celery. EOS raw
celery, I hate, but I love it in stews. I do actually like it. EOS
Yes, in stews. EOS I eat it because **anon** puts it in EOS but I
can’t say that it’s one of me favourite things. EOS Yes, no. But I
think- I think it was very difficult for our parents to feed- I mean,
there were th- three of us, ‘til **anon** was born. EOS had my sister,
in nineteen forty four, so- it was hard to- everything was so
rationed. EOS It was dreadful, you queued for everything. EOS And
sweets, when you think nowadays the shops are absolutely full of EOS I
suppose we were lucky that erm my aunties were still at home and they
gave us their sweet coupons. EOS Sweet coupons, yes. EOS And we used
to go to **anon**. EOS Oh yes, yes. EOS And er the main thing we had
were Barley sugars. EOS Oh gosh, really? EOS And occasionally a treat,
with a crunchie. EOS But it was- that was all you could get in those
days. EOS And then there was the powdered egg, EOS Oh gosh that
American powdered egg. EOS Canned coffee, ooh. EOS We w- we were very
lucky, we had erm- my grandfather wrote to a lady in America who had
been the fiancée of an uncle. EOS Who died in the first world war. EOS
And she went out and married someone else. And went out to America and
she sent us food parcels, all the way through the war. EOS Oh that was
nice, yeah. EOS She was very religious and the church that she went
to, they collected for the English people. EOS And they used to send
us some wonderful things over. EOS Erm and it must’ve been quite
expensive to get it over in those days, EOS over in tho- yes EOS they
wouldn’t be flown over. EOS It would’ve come by boat. EOS It’d take
weeks! EOS The only thing I hated was the wintergreen sweets that they
sent. EOS Oh I don’t remember those. I never had those. EOS Oh they
were dreadful, they were American, wintergreen, and the chocolate was
bad as well. EOS And I- I never liked those. EOS Well even now I don’t
think their chocolate is as nice as ours. EOS I don’t, no. EOS Because
**anon** and **anon** love Thorntons, EOS **anon** in particular you
know, the erm special toffee. And when me mum used to visit erm
**anon** in Chicago. EOS Take some decent cadburies chocolates. EOS
yes, yes, yes. EOS yes not as nice as hours. EOS But they used to
send- also, they collected clothes. EOS Clothes that were practically
new. And I absolutely hated them. Because my mother cut them down, EOS
to fit me and they were American style sleeves. EOS yes and you felt
different. EOS And I was different at school in them. And I absolutely
hated them. EOS I don’t remember that Maureen **anon**. I don’t
remember. EOS And they were beautiful things, I’m sure. EOS Yes, yes,
mm EOS But they weren’t what I wanted. But there were no clothes. EOS
I know, well-. EOS Very difficult to get. EOS Cos I know when people
got married- I th- **anon** got married at the end of the war, and it
wasn’t a white outfit, it was sort of a two EOS with a great big hat.
EOS She always wore a hat didn’t she? EOS mm, Well I- I remember my
mother making my eldest sister- half sister, erm, wedding cake. That
would be probably nineteen- **anon** was born in forty four, so this
would be forty five, I think. EOS And my mum- my mother had got all
the cake mixture, black market cake mixture of course. EOS Erm and she
made this wedding cake and she took it out of the oven and it fell
into three pieces. EOS oh your poor mum! EOS And she was absolutely
horrified because she’d been a cook, that was her- what she did as a
young woman, EOS and I think she got the almond paste and stuck it
together. EOS Where the cracks were. And iced over it and nobody knew
any EOS So that- but that stuck in my mind and yes, that’s amazing.
EOS Erm but I used to- I did a lot of the queuing fo- for food. EOS
But we had to do, didn’t we? EOS Yes because my mother had obviously
had my sister in nineteen forty EOS and I used to go and do all the-.
EOS I did the er- most of the errands. EOS Did you do it as well
Vivienne **anon**? EOS and we used to go to **anon** on the other side
of the trinity. Erm-. EOS And everything you know was sort of weighed
and very precise. EOS Oh absolutely. When you watch these- I love the
history programmes EOS and I do watch them and you know, what went on
in the war years. And they’re absolutely perfect because you know,
they are true footage. EOS Of what it was like and it makes you think,
‘how did we ever EOS Well we did, didn’t we? EOS We never went short.
Never went short. EOS No, we had probably just about enough but er-.
EOS Yes and yet it’s not done us any harm, has it? When you think EOS
Well we’re still here at seventy four and touch our toes, Vivienne EOS
I don’t know that I can touch my toes. EOS mm, I can. EOS Yes. Oh gosh
yes. EOS Mind you I’ve never tried but I’m sure I can’t. EOS I’m sure
I can’t. Oh dear. EOS yeah, yeah, well we’ve got our own teeth. EOS Oh
I haven’t. EOS Well I have half, the bottom. But I had mine out at
twenty six. EOS Oh did you? EOS Because I had terrible teeth. EOS Oh
right, right. EOS Look at her laughing! EOS We’ve got our own hair
colour! EOS Oh yeah and- well-. EOS With a bit of help EOS The
hairdresser’s very helpful EOS Absolutely. Erm, yes. EOS Erm you know
and what else? Well I’ve got contact lenses. I fool everyone cos I’ve
got contact lenses. EOS Ooh no I just- I couldn’t put those in, I
couldn’t mess with my eyes. EOS Oh gosh yes, yeah EOS I’ve had them
about- oh I don’t know, twenty five years, probably EOS mm, since I-
I’m more-. EOS I need my glasses for reading but I just couldn’t- EOS
if I had to wear them all the time, I’d have to wear them. Just
couldn’t put contact lenses in. **anon** does. But I couldn’t. EOS
Erm, well my grandson who’s eleven, well twelve tomorrow. He use- he
has contact lenses, **anon**. EOS And what a difference it’s made to
his life, and I taught him how to EOS Oh I’m sure. Really, yes. EOS
Yes, and erm I did explain it and I keep saying, you know, ‘you must
wash your hands, all the time!’ EOS Ooh hands going near your eyes.
EOS You don’t want to get infected eyes. And I spent a long time- .
EOS mm, Explaining it to him. EOS Explaining how to do it, and do you
know, he- he was brilliant. EOS And he’s so thrilled because he
doesn’t have to wear glasses any EOS Yes, made a big difference to him
at school. EOS Because children generally don’t like wearing glasses.
EOS They’re quite cruel aren’t they? Some of them. EOS Oh they are
yes. Yes that’s right. EOS I mean on the whole I think my school days
were happy days. EOS Yes I’m sure mine were really, yes. EOS But then
after **anon** we parted company didn’t we? EOS We did Vivienne
**anon** you went to the grammar school. EOS I went to **anon**
school. EOS And I went to a technical col- commercial college. EOS mm,
yes. And I suppose I did sports at the grammar school. EOS And w- and-
yes. EOS Erm hockey, rounders, athletics. EOS School choir. But I m-
that’s a bit like that now. All gone by the EOS I think they just had
netball at **anon** when I went there. EOS Did they? Well they had
netball but I- EOS I think being on the short side, I wasn’t very good
at netball. EOS I was better at hockey. EOS You are better when you’re
tall, yes. EOS And yet funny, my best friend, who was taller than me,
you know, EOS Yes oh yes. EOS She was good at the high jump. I did the
long jump. She did netball, I did hockey. We just did opposite things.
EOS mm, mm, yes. EOS And I think that’s partly to do with her being so
much taller than EOS Taller, yes, yes. EOS Now then. Funniest memories
from when we were young. EOS And as far as brothers and sisters of
course, I had- my father sadly lost his first wife with consumption as
they called it in those days. Er in nineteen twenty nine or stroke
thirty. Erm my sister was three. And my brother was a baby, about six
months old. EOS And my father was working, because of all the problems
with like today, jobs that are difficult. EOS And of course the
twenties and thir- well the twenties was very difficult. And he went
to live in Yorkshire. And-. EOS yeah- whereabouts in Yorkshire? EOS
Well I can’t just remember now, though I’m trying very hard to. There
was a very large erm- water supply, a big erm-. EOS Yes and it f- I
think it fed Leeds I think, up there, but it’s beautiful up there. And
they had-. EOS Is it the reservoir that you see when you’re on the
M-sixty two? EOS No, no it isn’t. EOS Erm and I have photographs of my
father up a telegraph pole, cos he EOS Oh was he? EOS Wiring it all
up. And they had houses as well, and that- my sister took me about
four or five years ago and the foundations of the houses which were
stone were still there. Just the foundations, EOS you could see where
they were. Erm and the water authority, it hadn’t been open actually
to the public and they’d o- EOS they’d o- they’d only just opened this
particular spot. EOS Erm and so it was quite you know, interesting to
go. EOS And obviously my father’s been dead twenty years now. Erm
but-. EOS Do you know I thought it would’ve been more than that,
Maureen EOS Erm, well my mother- father twen- EOS mother twenty and my
father twenty two I think. EOS And then what happened, she got this
consumption living there. Sadly and had to go to er a sanatorium. And
he took his two children back to Windermere where he came from. EOS
And his mother looked after them. EOS Looked after them, brought them
up. EOS And that’s how he met my mother EOS there. Erm, so it was
quite- really quite sad. EOS Sad yes yeah. EOS Yeah for him erm-. EOS
Well I can still picture your mother and father, you know- big EOS Mm,
yeah they were. Yes. EOS Tall, and I know when I used to go shopping
in Peel Green to the butchers and your mum would be walking along, and
I’d say, ‘how’s Maureen **anon**? Another little girl!’ EOS another
little girl, Yes. EOS Another little girl, one two three four. EOS Oh
yes. But then you see, what happened with- with grandchildren. Six EOS
And three granddaughters. EOS And five boys, one after the other. We
didn’t have any girls at all. EOS Yes that’s right. Funny that. EOS
Mm. But erm-. EOS Just I do remember when we used to go to church and
you were in the choir, like **anon** was in the choir. EOS And used to
go to **anon**, Christmas Eve, carol singing. EOS mm, really mm. EOS
And your Mum, I remember one year in particular your mum gave us all
erm hot chocolate before we went. EOS Did she really Vivienne
**anon**? EOS yes one Christmas eve. EOS Ooh you can remember things
better than me. EOS Yeah, she gave us erm hot chocolate before we all
set off for church. EOS Happy days those, really. EOS Oh, yes, that’s-
it is, probably were, yes. EOS But you and **anon**-. EOS But you
never got much for Christmas, I certainly didn’t. There were just no
toys at all. EOS Well you couldn’t- I think. EOS in the forties EOS
The one thing I remember getting at Christmas was a very nice- and it
was off a friend of my mum and dad’s. EOS A pencil box with a- that’s
erm roller top. EOS Oh I know. Yeah. EOS But, you know, you come down
Christmas day, and your presents would be on the table. There’d be
mine, **anon** and **anon**. EOS Because that was it, wasn’t it, EOS
and a bit of fruit? EOS Whatever- you know. EOS That’s right and a few
nuts. You alw- I had a pillowcase, always had a pillowcase and there
was nuts in the bottom, a tangerine and an EOS mm, oh a tangerine.
Yes. EOS And erm they were- I don’t know that it was quite exciting to
have those at the very bottom. EOS But I used to be so upset when
there was nothing left in it at all. EOS And wishing there were more
things, but there were no books Vivienne EOS and I never had a doll
for- I never played with dolls. EOS I- I wasn’t a doll person, I did
have one and I didn’t like it. EOS mm, well my mother-. EOS I did have
a nice doll’s pram. EOS And bicycle that me granddad bought. EOS But
it wasn’t at Christmas, it was sort of later on. EOS When you could
afford it. EOS exactly. Yes, yes. EOS You know cos they worked- worked
hard. EOS Well I do remember a book that I was bought. Two books- one
was ‘The prisoner of Zenda’ and ‘Rupert of Hensor.’ EOS Oh I don’t
remember that but I remember the first one. EOS And they were hideous
books, they were far too old for me. EOS I was just thinking that. EOS
And I c- I don’t really think I ever read them really. EOS but there
were no children’s books. But **anon** from the post office, her
parents could always find Rupert books. EOS Mm, she always had the
annuals for Rupert. And I was lucky, because she used to lend them to
me. EOS You know, and so I could read them. But I never had any books.
And my mother, desperate to get me a doll she went to the doll’s
hospital in EOS Oh I remember the doll’s hospital. EOS And you
remember that Vivienne **anon**. EOS Bought two heads and sewed them
on this- these bodies she’d made. EOS And I had- I always had a black
doll. EOS I absolutely loved black dolls, EOS more than white dolls.
Cos I just had this attraction f- for black dolls. And she got me a
black and a white one. And I went to see **anon** my friend at the
time. EOS She’s a mutual friend, **anon**. EOS We went to school with
her, didn’t we? EOS Yes, yeah. And **anon** dropped one of my dolls
EOS and the head smashed into pieces. EOS And I was so horrified I
lifted my arms up and dropped mine. So I had EOS none at all EOS So
both the heads had gone. EOS Oh what a shame and your mum had gone to
all that trouble. EOS mm, yes, yes. Yeah, she w- she wasn’t- wasn’t
particularly good at sewing. But erm, she went to quite a bit of
trouble to try and make up for what wasn’t there. EOS Something- What
we couldn’t have. EOS What we didn’t have, exactly. EOS But my sister
arriving in forty four. Everything went to her. EOS Er the- I- I could
not remember what a banana looked like. I hadn’t ever had one, you
see, EOS that I could remember. EOS I can’t remember when I was
little, no. Because I was three in thirty nine. So when the bananas
came, erm-. EOS Now I don’t know how many there were, whether there
was only one, but my father- it had to be **anon** that had the
banana. EOS I remember looking at this and thinking, ‘I wonder what it
really does taste like?’ EOS really does taste like. EOS And I didn’t
find out, and I wonder why they did that in those days. EOS They
could’ve given you half each. EOS Could’ve given us half each, EOS yes
they could actually. Erm so everything went to **anon**. Erm but it
never affected me in any way. EOS Never bothered you, no I mean-. EOS
I was never jealous. EOS I was the first grandchild, spoilt. And then
there was **anon** and then **anon** was the first grandson. And he
was spoilt. EOS mm, mm, mm EOS But because I suppose my nanna and
granddad- granddad in particular with **anon** I was- me nanna was for
me. EOS Me mum and dad tried to make it up to **anon**. They gave her
more. EOS mm, yes, yeah. EOS Like I went to the grammar school,
**anon** went to the grammar school, so erm- made sure that **anon**
went to **anon**. EOS Oh right, yes EOS And got a city and guilds in
erm-. EOS yes, catering, wasn’t it? EOS And then of course, **anon**
and **anon** EOS **anon** came along later on. EOS Yes, a lot later.
EOS But my grandparents lived in **anon**, as you know, and my
grandmother would give my half brother half a crow, which was quite a
bit of EOS Ooh a lot of money in those days. EOS And I was given
sixpence. EOS I never had what he had. Because he was the son, EOS you
know, the grandson. And apparently my father used to get so upset
about it and so annoyed, he’d take me home and give me half a crown.
EOS mm, crown as well. EOS Yes. Just to make it up. EOS mm, cos we
used to joke, you know me mum made a lot of our clothes for **anon**
and I. EOS And of course we’d say- course our **anon**’s came from
Kendal Mills EOS Yes, yeah. They were like that with sons. EOS But
erm- yes, yes. EOS For some reason and we’ve got far more equality
today. EOS And you don’t treat your children any different at whatever
age. EOS No, me mum and dad didn’t really, erm. EOS Erm, because er-
we’ve got a photograph of the three of us and a friend of **anon** had
knitted these fair-isle cardigans in two ply. EOS **anon** and I had
cardigans, **anon** had erm- I think it was a v-neck EOS And me mum
made sure that the three of us had the same. EOS Yes. Yes, quality,
mm, yeah. EOS Yes, yeah. Tried to treat us all the same. EOS But erm-
now then, what did I help out in the house a lot? Well I had to do.
EOS yes I’m sure I did, I’m sure we had to really. EOS Erm washing up
was always a pain, cos nobody wanted to dry. EOS It’s strange nobody
likes drying isn’t it? EOS No, no, nobody wanted to dry. So we used to
argue, the three of us, cos **anon** was too young. EOS Erm and they
used to- did they have no washing up liquid Vivienne EOS Oh I don’t
remember washing up-. EOS It was Persil. EOS Persil, no washing up
liq- EOS We used to put washing powder in EOS and wash the pots in
washing powder. EOS I don’t remember washing up liquid. EOS Oh they
didn’t have it, no, no, and my mother-. EOS But when you think no
washing up liquid, no washing machine, or things like that. EOS No- no
they boiled everything, didn’t they, in a boiler, EOS but I do
remember my mother grating fairy soap, white blocks- sorry green
blocks of fairy soap. EOS Green blocks of fairy soap. EOS And she
would grate it into the dolly tub. EOS Er with boiling water so it
melted, EOS an- and became- EOS so it would clean the clothes
properly. EOS mm, and then they- EOS And they always washed on a
Monday. EOS And ironed on a tuesday. EOS Yes, yes. If they got it dry.
EOS Yes, routine, routine EOS mm, was routine. And we had a cellar,
where my mother had clothes EOS We had cellars. EOS And she used to
hang her clothes EOS in the cellar to dry. And we did have a very old
coke burner down there for when the sirens went and there was bombing.
EOS Oh the sirens yes. EOS yeah and- and erm, my grandfather had gone
to the railways and he was a joiner, when he was younger and lived in
the Lake District. But he came down to live with us and erm he went
and got all these- erm, this- these pieces of wood from the railway
that- sleepers. EOS And he propped the whole of the ceiling of the
cellar up in case we had an air-raid or a bomb- EOS yes we had our own
sort of shelter at four-two-seven. EOS At six-six-three you used to go
down in the cellar. EOS But erm I remember my nan, my nanna and
**anon** heard the sirens. Went down into the cellar. **anon** came
home from work to find them in the cellar. ‘What you doing in the
cellar?’ ‘Well you know, the sirens went.’ They’d gone down for the
all-clear, hadn’t they? EOS and they’d been there all morning. EOS
Little things like that stick in your mind, don’t they? EOS Oh where
were your- where are you parents from, well mine are from the Lake
District. Both living in Windemere. Er back-to-back and never knew
each other. EOS Because my father was four years older than my mother.
But they didn’t find out until of course they met up, after his first
wife EOS And my- my mother was engaged to erm a- a man who went out to
Canada and lost all his money on the crash- EOS Wall Street crash. EOS
And said, ‘well I’ve got to start again, I’ll send for you,’ EOS and
she said, ‘don’t bother I’m not waiting.’ EOS And meanwhile her best
friend who was my father’s cousin, girl. Erm just asked her if she’d
like to co- go out, as a foursome because EOS my father had lost his
wife EOS and she wanted to cheer him up and that’s how I become- EOS
th- that’s how I ended up sitting here talking today. EOS If they’d
never got together I wouldn’t be here. EOS Well it’s true isn’t it?
EOS Yes oh life is strange isn’t it? Mm EOS It is, because **anon**
always wanted- he did his national service and always wanted to stay
in the army. EOS Oh did he? EOS Yes he loved it. Absolutely loved it.
EOS Oh so why didn’t he? EOS Because his mother and father said, ‘if
you stay in the army, that’s it you’ve no mother and father.’ EOS What
was the reason? EOS Because- well they thought it was erm a reflection
on them that he wanted to be away from home. EOS But they never really
got on, he got on better with his father than EOS but then his father
would say, ‘well if you’d stayed in the forces, you would never have
met Vivienne **anon**.’ EOS And he said, ‘well I’m sure we would have
done,’ EOS ‘because we were meant to be together.’ EOS So it’s funny
how things work out, isn’t it? EOS Yes. Yes, was he an only one? EOS
With a terrible mother. EOS Oh she was- . EOS Yes and yet she was in a
way possessive, and yet she hadn’t got a lot of time for him. So I
could never weigh it all up. Nothing ever made EOS Erm and his father
was away a lot on business. You know and if he did anything wrong,
‘wait ‘til your father comes home!’ EOS And one incident, he’d been
smoking when he was about ten or eleven, with a friend. Friend had a-
parents had a pub and they went on the flat roof and he was so ill.
And of course his mother, ‘wait ‘til your father comes home!’ and then
when his father came home told him, ‘aren’t you going to give him a
good hiding?’ So he said, ‘he’s learnt EOS And he never really smoked
cigarettes again. Occasionally, EOS if **anon** lit up he’d say, ‘ooh
I just fancy one,’ and he’d have one. EOS But he never went out and
bought a packet of cigarettes. EOS Mm, my parents didn’t smoke. But my
brother did, me half-brother did. And **anon** my half sister. EOS mm,
no me dad smoked but me mum couldn’t stand it. EOS Couldn’t stand it.
I’ve never smoked. EOS No, no I haven’t. EOS **anon** has smoked but
gave it up some years ago. EOS Erm **anon** has the odd one, more a
social- EOS doesn’t sit at home smoking. EOS **anon** doesn’t smoke,
**anon** doesn’t smoke. EOS mm, and actually my parents were tee-
total. EOS Until my father got to eighty and then he used to have his
brandy in a morning, to keep his heart going he used to say. EOS Well
they used to say a drop of whiskey at night is good for you. EOS Well
yes, they did. Yes, yes, but erm EOS That’s my excuse if I have one.
EOS It’s good for me! EOS Oh but erm, EOS cos you read all these
things in the paper, EOS you know and glass of red wine. EOS Well it’s
beer today, apparently. EOS I know that was in the paper the other
day. EOS Giving- yeah keeping your heart going. EOS Don’t like beer.
EOS I think I’ll do without, mm, mm EOS Don’t like beer at all. No.
EOS What are local people like? The people where I live- well they’re
all very nice really, it’s quite quiet, but it’s a- it’s such a good
area, I mean the house is up for sale, I can’t imagine why nobody buys
it. EOS Because it’s such a super spot to be, EOS you’ve got the
railway, you’ve got-. EOS mm, everything’s to hand isn’t it, yes EOS
Everything’s at hand, you’ve got sports centres, you’ve got swimming
pools, golf courses. EOS You can get into Manchester so quickly, and
you can get onto the M- sixty- sixty two, sixty-one, fifty six, in ten
minutes. EOS mm, I think you’re better placed than I am, in Irlam, EOS
because the buses are about- they’re supposed to be every ten minutes
but they’re not EOS and there’s only really one into Manchester. EOS
And there’s another one that goes through Manchester into the Trafford
centre, or the Trafford centre into Manchester. And they’re about the
only two. EOS Yes and the- the thing about the Trafford centre is- it-
I didn’t like it when it was first built, EOS I thought it would kill
off all the sho- local shops, which it did. EOS But I do enjoy going
and I go at least twice a week. EOS And I don’t particularly buy erm,
but I c- EOS if I want to, everything’s there. EOS You can, yeah, yeah
EOS I’ll just go because it’s very nice inside and you can have a nice
coffee and a cake on a morning. EOS In John Lewis, yes, mm EOS Yes.
And er- and I do quite enjoy going and it’s just so quick to get there
and to park and-. EOS It is, it’s no problem. EOS It’s just no
problem, so that’s a great advantage to this area to me. EOS I’ve
never been into Manchester for years and I don’t think I ever will
really. I’ve got- There’s nothing there for me. EOS Well I go into
Manchester erm, normally every Thursday to meet two friends I used to
work with many years ago at ICI. EOS Oh right. Yes, yes EOS And then I
meet another friend every other week on a Wednesday, EOS that I used
to work with at ICI. EOS So but normally I park in Marks and Spencers
and then on a Thursday have lunch in Marks, just a sandwich. One
friend moans the whole of the time EOS about the quality and the
standard and the noise, cos it is noisy in Marks and Spencers. EOS Now
if that particular friend doesn’t come, er **anon** and I will go EOS
which is erm an Austrian patisserie. EOS Ooh you should see the cakes!
EOS Mm, very nice. EOS Oh lovely. Erm then when I go with **anon** we
go to the **anon**. Where you can have a three course lunch for six
pounds fifty. EOS And I might walk through the Arndale centre EOS erm,
couple of times recently I have had a bit of a walk round the Arndale
but I’ve been looking for specific shops. EOS And there everything
seems that little bit bigger EOS than in the Trafford centre. EOS
Trafford centre, yes. EOS And on Sunday, **anon** and I and **anon**
we’d taken **anon** back to w- erm the station, erm we went into EOS
the Arndale and I think- I can’t remember what we were looking for.
But I was surprised, it was a Sunday and I was able to park in Marks
and Spencers car park. EOS It’s not cheap, parking in- EOS and it does
add- EOS it adds to me lunch when I go. I used to go on the bus. EOS
But you get on the bus and then there’s these girls that get on with
EOS dripping in cheap jewellery, EOS not a ring in sight, and oh. If
smoking was allowed they’d be EOS I’m not a snob EOS but you know, you
do have certain standards don’t you? EOS I think it’s the way we were
brought up Maureen **anon**, respect. EOS In those days. EOS Yeah. Yes
probably. EOS You respected your teachers and- EOS and we went to
church and Sunday school, didn’t we? EOS Yes we did. We certainly did.
EOS And then the pictures after church on a Sunday night sometimes,
the EOS When you think about it. EOS mm, yes we used to go on to the
pictures after we’d been to church. EOS mm. And we’d done our duty,
hadn’t we? EOS we’d been to church. EOS Well, definitely! Yes those
were the days. EOS But I think, I remember it being more difficult for
food, clothes and everything else after nineteen forty five. Because
that’s when it was really difficult, when they put bread on rationing.
That was awful. EOS Yes because rationing went on for quite some time,
didn’t it? EOS It went to about fifty two I think. EOS Yes it went on
for some time. EOS But it went worse- I don’t think we probably got
the help from America that we’d had during the war. EOS Or thought we
were going to get. EOS yeah I think so, mm. EOS Because there was the
air base in Warrington wasn’t there? Burtonwood EOS Yes. The
Americans, mm. EOS erm and I know a friend of my auntie’s went out
with one of the EOS and er- he used to take to erm **anon**,
girlfriend, loads of sweets EOS So you know we had sweets. EOS in that
way. EOS But it was a long time before things were really back to
normal. EOS Anything like- well, above- above the counter. EOS And on
show, everything was under the counter. EOS Nothing was on show. No
food was on show. EOS And I know we had a chicken nearly ever week and
it was a friend of my granddad’s and me dad’s, used to get these live
chickens EOS and they were in Pendleton, and I had to go on the bus
and bring back EOS Dead chicken, was it plucked? EOS Alive Maureen
**anon**! EOS Oh you didn’t! EOS And I’d no choice, I had to do it.
EOS How did you carry it? EOS It used to be in a bag, and EOS I’d be
sitting on the bus, terrified in case it made a noise. EOS Our
**anon** would say that he did it, but if he did it, I don’t remember.
It was me, because I was the eldest. EOS He might have come on the odd
occasion to keep me company. EOS But in the main, it was me. So we
always had-. EOS Can I ask you, EOS did you eat any of it when you got
home? EOS Oh once me mum had killed it and cleaned it and everything.
EOS And prepared it, oh EOS And it- mainly boiling . EOS And she used
to make beautiful chicken soup. EOS And erm our **anon** always had
the best of the chicken. And me mum would hide it under his rice, so
that **anon** and I couldn’t see it. EOS Really? Oh that’s not right
at all is it? EOS But that’s how it was, he got the best. EOS It was,
yes, he did. EOS And er- I mean we laugh about it, EOS and the thing
is, although we know that he was in a way favoured, it never, has
never- EOS Any animosity between you. EOS There’s never been any
jealousy among us. EOS Between the five of us, at all really. EOS mm,
mm, my mother lived on a farm, erm, and my grandfather was a EOS Which
was- it- you know he- he rented and he worked for the farmer and it
was in Warrington, cos he came down all the way from the Lake
District, how they got down I’ve no idea. EOS No, no motorways. EOS
But they always- no and they were on this farm called **anon**, which
is still there in- in Warrington, Daresbury actually. EOS And my
mother went to school at Daresbury village. And erm she said that my
father- my grandfather always had- if they had an egg, they only got
the top off the egg, EOS and gra- and her father got the whole egg.
EOS Cos he was the working- he was working. EOS and he was providing.
EOS And she said there was ce- EOS there were- there were lots of
vegetables, and she said, ‘he never took anything that wasn’t his’.
EOS And she said, ‘we could’ve lived really well if he’d just- taken a
few of these veggies and brought them home.’ EOS Yeah, vegetables, mm
EOS But he never did. Never took anything that wasn’t theirs they were
so EOS Mm, then they went back of course, went back to erm-. EOS The
Lake District. EOS Yes went back to Ulverston, mm EOS mm, I was
looking at the Lake District on the telly the other night, erm- did
you watch it? EOS Yes, yes I did actually, I’d seen it before. EOS
Yes, I’ve seen it before but I watched it again. EOS Erm and I
thought, ‘oh we did have some nice little breaks up in the lake
district.’ EOS Yes. My cousin that still lives there, erm her grandson
is erm- well his girlfriend, who lives on **anon**, which is the
island that nobody’s- EOS mmhmm, yes, in the middle bit EOS I’ve often
wondered if anybody lived there. EOS yes, it’s a beautiful house EOS
Is it, mm, mm EOS It’s the **anon** that have got that. The people who
had the insurance company, **anon** insurance company. EOS And they
bought the island and they live there. And this is their daughter. And
she swam the English channel about two weeks ago. EOS For charity,
yes. EOS She’s a st- I think she’s a student now, I- I th- - I’m not
sure whether- she’s got two grandsons, and I’m not sure whether this
particular grandson is the one that’s living locally in Manchester,
EOS come down from the Lake District erm cos there are two of them and
I do get them confused and they’re both at university, or one has EOS
mm, mm, yes, yeah. EOS But this girlfriend, yeah she swam the English
channel. Yes. EOS swam the channel. EOS Cos she- she let me know the
other week about it, yeah. EOS mm, what about hat older lady swimming
it? And kept going off course? EOS Oh did she, I’ve no- I didn’t see
that. EOS Yeah and I’ve forgot- I’ve forgotten how long it took her,
EOS but she did it. But it took her hours and hours. EOS The English
Channel? EOS Hours and hours and hours. EOS You’ve got the jellyfish
problem with the English Channel. EOS haven’t you, really? Mm, EOS No
it was nice, watching the Lake District, yes EOS Yes very beautiful if
it’s not raining. EOS Ooh, the very first time we went on the Friday
afternoon, it was raining so hard. EOS ‘Oh what have we done, why have
we come?’ But then Saturday and Sunday it was glorious. EOS mm, mm,
beautiful, mm EOS Mm, they’ve had very bad weather this last winter.
EOS Mm with the snow and everything. EOS Yes a lot of- yes, yeah and
rain. EOS I mean that’s why I can’t understand the reservoirs being so
low. EOS When we’ve had so much snow. EOS My cousin, when she was
telling me about these- this er grandson’s girlfriend. Erm she said,
‘oh you wouldn’t believe how low they are.’ She said, ‘we’ve been out
and we’ve been looking and they’re extremely EOS I know when we used
to drive over to Harrogate erm on the M-sixty- two, we always looked
at one reservoir, EOS ‘oh it’s a bit low this y- this week.’ EOS Do
you know the one I mean? EOS Yeah, yeah I go that way. EOS Yes and er
we’d be sort of, ‘oh there’s going to be a water EOS our **anon** had
to defy the hosepipe ban before. EOS He what, sorry? EOS Had to defy
the hosepipe ban. Because our **anon** got all dog’s poo on EOS And so
he had to swill them down. EOS Did he? I hope this is not being used
in evidence against him EOS for a thousand pounds. EOS I never thought
about that EOS mm, well I mean, I use my hosepipe to fill my watering
can and my gra- my son-in-law said, ‘you can’t do that it’s illegal.’
I said, ‘rubbish. It can’t be illegal.’ But I’ll tell you one thing.
This hosepipe ban is so ridiculous cos you waste more money- sorry
more EOS In a watering can. EOS Well I think so, Maureen **anon** too.
EOS Because you’re being- it’s pouring out and EOS and if it was
coming out as a spray EOS and a shower, it would go into the flowers
and everything quicker. EOS But it’s just going over the tops and- and
going on the- one the road. On the pavements. EOS I think it’s worse.
EOS I think it’s silly. EOS Mm, I do. Yes, but still. EOS I can
understand them saying the hosepipe ban for washing cars at EOS Well
at home but what about these- EOS but you can still- EOS can you still
take them to the-? EOS Oh yes you can still take them to these places.
EOS Places to have them cleaned. Oh right, right. I didn’t realise
that. EOS I mean the gardeners that I have, **anon** said that he’d
looked it up on the erm internet EOS and it was so complicated, what
you could, what you couldn’t do, EOS oh yes, yes, EOS that in the end,
he gave up. EOS United utilities saying one thing, somebody else
saying something else, and he thought, ‘just don’t get it.’ EOS mmhmm,
mm, no. Well my- I’ve got one hanging basket, beautiful EOS because
it’s rained on it and the other one is slightly under the EOS at the
front door and it’s dead. EOS And **anon** never bothered watering it.
So I’ve had to get it down and just let the tap run on it, EOS so
that’s wasted a lot of water. EOS Yeah, yeah, yeah. EOS Today, whether
it will revive, I don’t think it will. EOS mm, c- It will, it will cos
they said to me on Tuesday, I said, ‘I know what you’re going to say,’
I said, ‘well you see it has rained so I thought to myself ‘I don’t
need to water them,’ EOS But you still need to water them, so-. EOS Oh
gosh you do because it doesn’t get through. EOS It only stays on the
top. EOS Hmm, how are we doing?
