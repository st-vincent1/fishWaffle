stuff and he’s like, ‘have you done that?’, and like, ‘no’, and he’s
like, ‘oh, I’ll just sign it off anyway’... he- he has got to be the
worst teacher... so then he- he comes up to me and he’s like, ‘so how-

it’s gotta be from school when- she’s from and she’s got like the
strongest accent ever, erm, she had a baby, and she was like- we were
like, ‘what’ve you called your baby?’ and she’s like, ‘’ , ‘oh,

name,... because she couldn’t say ‘haitches', we weren’t sure if her
name was or for like a year... why couldn’t she say ‘haitches’?...
cause she was that common... sounding she used to call all time-... on
away- he’s away... she used to speak to , and erm, she’d call him and
sh- he’d be like, ‘’ all the time and she’d- I think she used to do it
on purpose, say words with ‘haitches’... mmhmm... and she used to go,
‘do you want a chuffty badge?’ when- if you thought, like, if you got
something right or you were proud of yourself or something... why
would you want a chuffty badge?... and she used to actually make them
like, if you were doing something like, creative, like ‘do a title
page for your book’ she’d get like stickers out and make a chuffty
badge, like... oh I see... ‘here’s your chuffty badge’... standard...

that bitchy chef that always used to come over and be like, ‘you can’t
save all the cakes’, like, ‘well, we don’t wanna save all of them, but
we’re not gonna chuck them all away, people are hungry’... ‘people
aren’t gonna’ chefs are well mean... I know... our chefs are mean at

probably ask me like, ‘is there this and this’, I’ll be like, ‘I don’t
know’, some woman came up to me yesterday and w- well, not yesterday
the other day when I was really, really busy, the only one behind the
hot plate, and she was like this, ‘can I just ask you a few questions
about the ingredients?’, I was like, ‘in a minute’... Alan , Alan ,

so I lifted the coat up and stood under it... you pussy I remember
when high school, there was like the bikes and erm, my sister’s like,
‘right, wait there’... ten past three, ‘don’t move until I’m here,
wait there Nadine wait there’ I went, ‘okay’ and then I met and then
we walked round and saw like all our chum mates and that was it...
erm... and we used to all get lost as a four, just to be late to
lesson, standard... I remember on the second day, erm, of school we
had PE... I remember in the first day of year two I was- told my Mum
she didn’t need to come and pick me up again, I’m walking home and my
Mum never p- walked to school **inc** pick me up ever again so yeah,
and erm... that’s good... oh yeah... hmm... it wasn’t that far really

bitch... we’ve gotta- he’s cutting her hair at three o’clock and he’ll
have to be quick or she’ll fall asleep... can’t she just like fall
asleep and then you just do it... that’d be a bit dangerous someone
trying to cut their hair... hmm, suppose... imagine if she started
sleep walking like that guy... ahhh, that guy was mank, I swear we’re
gonna watch that on CTV... I wanna see it... ahh, no, did I tell you
about getting told off from the CTV camera?... no... hot plate, -
sprawled out across the thingy, right was like showing it to , comes
in cos we’re like laying up the chalet, and goes, ‘who’s this, who’s
this?’ and I was ‘oh, that was before on the hot plate’, went ape shit
at him, honest to God, it was so funny... why’s getting involved
though?... cause came into see us cos she’s been away, and she’s like
missed them, so she came into see us all, and then she was like,
‘right, what’s the goss’ and then she went to and was like, ‘ah, come
and have a look at this, come what did’ I wouldn’t mind, but he only
came in at eight, and then he ha- he was like sprawled across, and was
like, ‘I wouldn’t mind but you didn’t even go out last night’...
‘don’t agree to breakfast if you couldn’t’ he was the one who got us
into trouble with the customers, apparently we’re moody people and we
don’t wanna be here so... the other week, well, no, this week, erm,
some woman came into work and erm, she was speaking to and was like,
‘right, so, what we want is, we want the erm, late lunch’ and she was
like, ‘I don’t know if the late lunch is on today actually’ and then
she was like, ‘well, it’s outside’ and so then she was like-... what’s
a late lunch?... the late- it’s just a menu that we do when the
regular lunches come off, we do a late lunch, so, they do t- like, cos
they normally don’t do stuff to order, they do shepherds pie...
scampi, and erm, sticky mango chicken-... so it’s a bit like a
buffet... no, cos they cook it f- like, to order... mm... and you get
it brought over to you and everything, so, but the main lunch was
still out, so she goes and asks if they’re doing it, and then erm, she
was like he said something like, erm, ‘we won’t be doing it until
like, half three’ or something, then she was like, ‘right, can we
order it now, and come back’ or something and then she was like,
‘right, we want two child’s portions of the shepherds pie’... why
child?... she goes, ‘well, we can’t do child’s portions of the
shepherds pie’ she’s like, ‘why?’, ‘they’re already portioned up in an
adults portion, and they’re that price, and it doesn’t say anywhere
that we can do a child’s portion’ and she’s like, ‘well, we want
child’s portions, this is absolutely ridiculous’ so she’s basically on
one, she’s having a go at erm, then like, wouldn’t stop, I don’t know
what even she was saying to her, I kind of looked over at her, and
then in the end she was like, ‘it’s not very good, you’re loosing five
customers here that nanana’... and going on with herself, in the end
she walks out, I turned to and said, ‘are you alright?’ like this, and
then she smiles and kind of goes, ‘yeah’ and kind of like laughed it
off, but kind of just to say, ‘yeah, it’s fine’, the woman comes back
like, thirty seconds later, ‘I don’t think it’s right that you’re
laughing at us as soon as we leave’, I was like,... ‘excuse me, we
weren’t laughing at her, I asked her if she was alright’, and she was
like, ‘no, I don’t think it’s very funny, you’re laughing at us and
we’re walking away, you’re- this... what was that? mm... **inc**...
yeah, think so... ahh... I’m just gonna carry on anyway... yeah, carry
on... **inc** erm... so what else did she say... she just said that
really... didn’t she walked away and you laughed again?... yeah, then
she walked away, and no-one even realised... well you- to be fair, you
were laughing... no, we weren’t laughing, I asked her if she was
alright, because... cheeky bitch... it was quite personal the way that
she was saying to her, like, ‘w- why- what are you’ she kept saying to
her, ‘what are you gonna do about it?’... and she was like, ‘there’s
nothing I can do about it’ and in the end she- I thought that she’d
just leave it, the woman, and erm, erm, thought that or would step in
and say something to her, but they didn’t even know what was going on,
we had to say it to later on, oh, it was ridiculous it’s so
horrible... **inc** **inc** you’re so mean, I’m a good girl when I’m
in work... what are local people like in ?... shit, I don’t speak to
them... I hate , with a passion... what’s wrong with it?... it’s just
not right, you know it’s not right can’t bel- believe my Mum kicked
off about it erm, you know when said, at the meal... said what?...

‘oh, you moving?’... and sh- sh- Mum goes, ‘yeah’, and then I went,
‘yeah’ and like, ‘oh, where do you wanna move round- round here
again?’ and she goes, ‘aye, don’t you?’ and then you said something,
and you were like, ‘I couldn’t turn back time’ and it’s like, ‘if we
could turn back time’... oh yeah... and then your Mum was like, ‘yeah’
and I was like, ‘bloody hell, it’s starting now’, can’t believe she
said it she knows I wouldn’t move... wouldn’t have moved from here?...

could do it... what? pr- pr- pr- problem is right, was trying to do it
again and it wasn’t funny... oh... it had- it was like one of them
moment ones where it had to be there, it’s like, carry on from the
conversation, isn’t it, innit... yeah... swerve it... mm... but yeah

used to have napkins, and I used to like take her order, used to have
like a little apron out- made out of a tea towel, and I used to like
make- tell her to sit there and she used to have to proper like
pretend she was eating, I’m like, ‘right Nan, you’ve finished that

pans out and stuff and like, yeah, ‘I’m cooking Nan’ she’s like, ‘what

along’... ‘you can decide what you’re eating’... yeah... ‘it’s up to
you’ hmm... erm, I dunno, it was always school or home I remember
being-... yeah, it’s really hard to think about what you used to play
as a kid... we used to play shoe competition on the swings... shoe

I’m like, ‘why’,... ‘I need to put back on the weight that I’ve burnt
off’... that’s not the purpose of the gym, for... I only went to keep
her company, I didn’t say I needed to loose some weight problem is,
she got knackered before me... well, obviously you’re meant to be at
the gym then aren’t you?... mm, well that’s what she said but I-...

boring... I dunno... go like swimming or something keeps you more
entertained... swimming’s not that entertaining... it is... how is it?
Just looking at water... dunno, don’t feel like you’re doing much...
it’s entertaining when swimming... why?... have you not- have I not
told you about how swims?... no, I thought we were going swimming
today, see, we could’ve gone swimming... because you didn’t go to the
gym... right, anyway when - when -... no, no, don’t change the
subject... I was- I- we were talking about this subject first, you
changed the subject... yeah, because you’re the one who said we could
go swimming and... well-... you’re like, ‘ah no, I’m going to the-’
yeah I might tell my Mum to come early and drag her swimming with
us... right so - when... that sounds like a plan done it... when
swimming... ahh, and the chips from that s- yeah, sorry... but- yeah,
the chips in make me always feel sick... ahh, they used to be fit...
cause of the smell from the- all the chlorine... they’re fit, fit as,
that used to be like, weekend, me and my sister, that’s what I did
with my sister, go swimming with the floats, and you know if you had
arm bands you weren’t allowed to go past like a certain, like-... did
you ever put armbands on someone’s feet?... no... I did... nearly
died, the lifeguard goes, he was like, ‘take them off, now’... why?...
because... you put armbands on your feet, and you go like that, and as
soon as you let go they go, pff, like that and you go upside down...
standard... and they’re like stuck on your ankles... so you can’t get
them off either... which ones did you have? Them blow-up ones that you
couldn’t put on your arm like , and you can ne-... pink ones...
pink... yeah... you’re a boy... yeah, no, they weren’t like... my
bum’s sore now... bought them cos they were pink, they were like the
pink ones that they sold there cos they had like yellow ones-... do
you remember the rubber ring ones that you can get now... no...
yeah... but anyway, as I was saying, when swimming... bum’s sore...
like when we were on holiday, he’ll like go in and he looks like- like
he’s like, his neck’s like this, like the water’s there... and- and-
so he’s like this, and then every now and again he’ll go under and
he’ll be like spitting water out, like,... oh my God, and he
constantly looks like he’s just going to die... like he’s stand there,
and he’s like- and he always grabs onto people like, ‘’ and then... so
as you as you get, like, when we’re on holiday, he’ll like be drowning
me and I’ll do like, that to him and-... can he not swim?... he can
swim, just about, like, with that **inc**... like, dying, I’m like,
‘oh my God, you’re the worst swimmer ever’... I bet you’re not that
good... I’m better than him anyway... I bet you’re not that good did

high school, no, we never did it in high school... you didn’t do it in
high school? Jammy **inc**... no, we only did it in Primary... we had
to do it all the way to year, erm, eleven, it’s only cos people
couldn’t swim in our class... no, they seriously couldn’t, no-one
could swim in our class apart from me... it’s like, really bad, she’d
right- ‘we’ll do front crawl’, and we all had to like, be in the lanes
cos, to like, our class was that small we had one lane each... and no
joke, she says, ‘do front crawl’, no one could do it, they’ll do doggy
paddle, she’s like, ‘ah, do backstroke’, everyone could do backstroke
apart from the ones who used to just kick their legs... yeah, I know,
your arm-... and then-... your arms don’t really help with backstroke
though, I don’t think... no, I never see the point, and then erm,...
you just always wet your face and stuff... the breaststroke cou- no-
one could- everyone could do the arms, but then they didn’t do the
legs... right, they just like kicked their legs,... no, you don’t do,

the same, cos you’re meant to glide in the s- yeah... you see, yeah,

wanted to go in the deep end... I’ve never pl I was gonna, ah- I was
gonna ask the most stupid question then... go on... it wasn’t about
