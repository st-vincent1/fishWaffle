EOS he’s one of the chefs, but he’s doing an apprenticeship with and
he had - erm, no, he had EOS oooh EOS and he had, erm, whats-his-name
grey hair he had and EOS ahh, ace EOS erm, for like his lessons, but
then comes every month and asks him like, what’s he’s done and he has
to do all this different cooking stuff and he’s like, ‘have you done
that?’, and like, ‘no’, and he’s like, ‘oh, I’ll just sign it off
anyway’ EOS he- he has got to be the worst teacher EOS so then he- he
comes up to me and he’s like, ‘so how- is this where you’ve been
hanging out?’ EOS **inc**, ‘have you handed all your work in?’, and I
was like, ‘yes’, erm, and I was like what was he going on about? he

sheet each week we had him EOS well, he didn’t though did he EOS he’s

the top- EOS tops coming out and you can just see more and more of his
arse, everyone’s like, ‘urgh’ EOS oh my God EOS and it’s like, ‘, why

**inc** EOS her best mate was like dying of cancer EOS yeah, but she
did often go in moods and stuff EOS mm EOS if you said stuff or- EOS
she never went in a mood with me, she did go in a mood in a restaurant
though when we EOS yeah she always seemed to take things too personal,
as well sometimes but my wor- EOS mm EOS my actual worst teacher I
think about when it- it’s gotta be from school when- she’s from and
she’s got like the strongest accent ever, erm, she had a baby, and she
was like- we were like, ‘what’ve you called your baby?’ and she’s
like, ‘’ , ‘oh, great’, and then erm, she got married and then we
weren’t sure if her name, EOS because she couldn’t say ‘haitches', we
weren’t sure if her name was or for like a year EOS why couldn’t she
say ‘haitches’? EOS cause she was that common EOS sounding she used to
call all time- EOS on away- he’s away EOS she used to speak to , and
erm, she’d call him and sh- he’d be like, ‘’ all the time and she’d- I
think she used to do it on purpose, say words with ‘haitches’ EOS
mmhmm EOS and she used to go, ‘do you want a chuffty badge?’ when- if
you thought, like, if you got something right or you were proud of
yourself or something EOS why would you want a chuffty badge? EOS and
she used to actually make them like, if you were doing something like,
creative, like ‘do a title page for your book’ she’d get like stickers
out and make a chuffty badge, like EOS oh I see EOS ‘here’s your
chuffty badge’ EOS standard EOS mm do you reckon who I’ll always
remember from college EOS go on EOS ? ah, that beasty EOS she’s- sh-

coffee and it’s just so rank EOS the cakes were good there but then
there was that bitchy chef that always used to come over and be like,
‘you can’t save all the cakes’, like, ‘well, we don’t wanna save all
of them, but we’re not gonna chuck them all away, people are hungry’
EOS ‘people aren’t gonna’ chefs are well mean EOS I know EOS our chefs

you’ll be like, ‘ahh, is this Nadine ?’ EOS yeah EOS it’s so annoying,
they’ll- and they’ll probably ask me like, ‘is there this and this’,
I’ll be like, ‘I don’t know’, some woman came up to me yesterday and
w- well, not yesterday the other day when I was really, really busy,
the only one behind the hot plate, and she was like this, ‘can I just
ask you a few questions about the ingredients?’, I was like, ‘in a

thought you meant like primary school EOS I don’t- oh, I remember
hiding behind my Mum’s coat in primary school EOS why? EOS she had a
big long coat, and I didn’t wanna say hi to anyone, so I lifted the
coat up and stood under it EOS you pussy I remember when high school,
there was like the bikes and erm, my sister’s like, ‘right, wait
there’ EOS ten past three, ‘don’t move until I’m here, wait there
Nadine wait there’ I went, ‘okay’ and then I met and then we walked
round and saw like all our chum mates and that was it EOS erm EOS and
we used to all get lost as a four, just to be late to lesson, standard
EOS I remember on the second day, erm, of school we had PE EOS I
remember in the first day of year two I was- told my Mum she didn’t
need to come and pick me up again, I’m walking home and my Mum never
p- walked to school **inc** pick me up ever again so yeah, and erm EOS
that’s good EOS oh yeah EOS hmm EOS it wasn’t that far really from me
house, it was quite far actually for year twos EOS pah EOS mm, mm, mm,

pick the stuff up EOS oh, so you’re not staying? EOS no EOS moody
bitch EOS we’ve gotta- he’s cutting her hair at three o’clock and
he’ll have to be quick or she’ll fall asleep EOS can’t she just like
fall asleep and then you just do it EOS that’d be a bit dangerous
someone trying to cut their hair EOS hmm, suppose EOS imagine if she
started sleep walking like that guy EOS ahhh, that guy was mank, I
swear we’re gonna watch that on CTV EOS I wanna see it EOS ahh, no,
did I tell you about getting told off from the CTV camera? EOS no EOS
hot plate, - sprawled out across the thingy, right was like showing it
to , comes in cos we’re like laying up the chalet, and goes, ‘who’s
this, who’s this?’ and I was ‘oh, that was before on the hot plate’,
went ape shit at him, honest to God, it was so funny EOS why’s getting
involved though? EOS cause came into see us cos she’s been away, and
she’s like missed them, so she came into see us all, and then she was
like, ‘right, what’s the goss’ and then she went to and was like, ‘ah,
come and have a look at this, come what did’ I wouldn’t mind, but he
only came in at eight, and then he ha- he was like sprawled across,
and was like, ‘I wouldn’t mind but you didn’t even go out last night’
EOS ‘don’t agree to breakfast if you couldn’t’ he was the one who got
us into trouble with the customers, apparently we’re moody people and
we don’t wanna be here so EOS the other week, well, no, this week,
erm, some woman came into work and erm, she was speaking to and was
like, ‘right, so, what we want is, we want the erm, late lunch’ and
she was like, ‘I don’t know if the late lunch is on today actually’
and then she was like, ‘well, it’s outside’ and so then she was like-
EOS what’s a late lunch? EOS the late- it’s just a menu that we do
when the regular lunches come off, we do a late lunch, so, they do t-
like, cos they normally don’t do stuff to order, they do shepherds pie
EOS scampi, and erm, sticky mango chicken- EOS so it’s a bit like a
buffet EOS no, cos they cook it f- like, to order EOS mm EOS and you
get it brought over to you and everything, so, but the main lunch was
still out, so she goes and asks if they’re doing it, and then erm, she
was like he said something like, erm, ‘we won’t be doing it until
like, half three’ or something, then she was like, ‘right, can we
order it now, and come back’ or something and then she was like,
‘right, we want two child’s portions of the shepherds pie’ EOS why
child? EOS she goes, ‘well, we can’t do child’s portions of the
shepherds pie’ she’s like, ‘why?’, ‘they’re already portioned up in an
adults portion, and they’re that price, and it doesn’t say anywhere
that we can do a child’s portion’ and she’s like, ‘well, we want
child’s portions, this is absolutely ridiculous’ so she’s basically on
one, she’s having a go at erm, then like, wouldn’t stop, I don’t know
what even she was saying to her, I kind of looked over at her, and
then in the end she was like, ‘it’s not very good, you’re loosing five
customers here that nanana’ EOS and going on with herself, in the end
she walks out, I turned to and said, ‘are you alright?’ like this, and
then she smiles and kind of goes, ‘yeah’ and kind of like laughed it
off, but kind of just to say, ‘yeah, it’s fine’, the woman comes back
like, thirty seconds later, ‘I don’t think it’s right that you’re
laughing at us as soon as we leave’, I was like, EOS ‘excuse me, we
weren’t laughing at her, I asked her if she was alright’, and she was
like, ‘no, I don’t think it’s very funny, you’re laughing at us and
we’re walking away, you’re- this EOS what was that? mm EOS **inc** EOS
yeah, think so EOS ahh EOS I’m just gonna carry on anyway EOS yeah,
carry on EOS **inc** erm EOS so what else did she say EOS she just
said that really EOS didn’t she walked away and you laughed again? EOS
yeah, then she walked away, and no-one even realised EOS well you- to
be fair, you were laughing EOS no, we weren’t laughing, I asked her if
she was alright, because EOS cheeky bitch EOS it was quite personal
the way that she was saying to her, like, ‘w- why- what are you’ she
kept saying to her, ‘what are you gonna do about it?’ EOS and she was
like, ‘there’s nothing I can do about it’ and in the end she- I
thought that she’d just leave it, the woman, and erm, erm, thought
that or would step in and say something to her, but they didn’t even
know what was going on, we had to say it to later on, oh, it was
ridiculous it’s so horrible EOS **inc** **inc** you’re so mean, I’m a
good girl when I’m in work EOS what are local people like in ? EOS
shit, I don’t speak to them EOS I hate , with a passion EOS what’s

house being up, and goes ‘oh, you moving?’ EOS and sh- sh- Mum goes,
‘yeah’, and then I went, ‘yeah’ and like, ‘oh, where do you wanna move

said something, and you were like, ‘I couldn’t turn back time’ and
it’s like, ‘if we could turn back time’ EOS oh yeah EOS and then your
Mum was like, ‘yeah’ and I was like, ‘bloody hell, it’s starting now’,

cousins? EOS I used to go to my cousins every Saturday EOS where’s the

never used to have napkins, and I used to like take her order, used to
have like a little apron out- made out of a tea towel, and I used to
like make- tell her to sit there and she used to have to proper like
pretend she was eating, I’m like, ‘right Nan, you’ve finished that

pans out and stuff and like, yeah, ‘I’m cooking Nan’ she’s like, ‘what

EOS ‘you can decide what you’re eating’ EOS yeah EOS ‘it’s up to you’
hmm EOS erm, I dunno, it was always school or home I remember being-

happened in like, years EOS what? EOS when you were like ‘I’ve been to
the gym, I need to eat’ EOS I’m like, ‘why’, EOS ‘I need to put back
on the weight that I’ve burnt off’ EOS that’s not the purpose of the
gym, for EOS I only went to keep her company, I didn’t say I needed to
loose some weight problem is, she got knackered before me EOS well,
obviously you’re meant to be at the gym then aren’t you? EOS mm, well
that’s what she said but I- EOS how can you just like do exercise for
an hour and a half gets so boring EOS I dunno EOS go like swimming or
something keeps you more entertained EOS swimming’s not that

swimming EOS because you didn’t go to the gym EOS right, anyway when -
when - EOS no, no, don’t change the subject EOS I was- I- we were
talking about this subject first, you changed the subject EOS yeah,
because you’re the one who said we could go swimming and EOS well- EOS
you’re like, ‘ah no, I’m going to the-’ yeah I might tell my Mum to
come early and drag her swimming with us EOS right so - when EOS that
sounds like a plan done it EOS when swimming EOS ahh, and the chips
from that s- yeah, sorry EOS but- yeah, the chips in make me always
feel sick EOS ahh, they used to be fit EOS cause of the smell from
the- all the chlorine EOS they’re fit, fit as, that used to be like,
weekend, me and my sister, that’s what I did with my sister, go
swimming with the floats, and you know if you had arm bands you
weren’t allowed to go past like a certain, like- EOS did you ever put
armbands on someone’s feet? EOS no EOS I did EOS nearly died, the
lifeguard goes, he was like, ‘take them off, now’ EOS why? EOS because
EOS you put armbands on your feet, and you go like that, and as soon
as you let go they go, pff, like that and you go upside down EOS
standard EOS and they’re like stuck on your ankles EOS so you can’t
get them off either EOS which ones did you have? Them blow-up ones
that you couldn’t put on your arm like , and you can ne- EOS pink ones
EOS pink EOS yeah EOS you’re a boy EOS yeah, no, they weren’t like EOS
my bum’s sore now EOS bought them cos they were pink, they were like
the pink ones that they sold there cos they had like yellow ones- EOS
do you remember the rubber ring ones that you can get now EOS no EOS
yeah EOS but anyway, as I was saying, when swimming EOS bum’s sore EOS
like when we were on holiday, he’ll like go in and he looks like- like
he’s like, his neck’s like this, like the water’s there EOS and- and-
so he’s like this, and then every now and again he’ll go under and
he’ll be like spitting water out, like, EOS oh my God, and he
constantly looks like he’s just going to die EOS like he’s stand
there, and he’s like- and he always grabs onto people like, ‘’ and
then EOS so as you as you get, like, when we’re on holiday, he’ll like
be drowning me and I’ll do like, that to him and- EOS can he not swim?
EOS he can swim, just about, like, with that **inc** EOS like, dying,
I’m like, ‘oh my God, you’re the worst swimmer ever’ EOS I bet you’re
not that good EOS I’m better than him anyway EOS I bet you’re not that
good did you used to go swimming in high school? EOS yeah EOS ‘til
what age? They’re meant to stop after the first two- two years
apparently EOS yeah, we only did it in year seven- year five and year
six, oh not in high school, no, we never did it in high school EOS you
didn’t do it in high school? Jammy **inc** EOS no, we only did it in
Primary EOS we had to do it all the way to year, erm, eleven, it’s
only cos people couldn’t swim in our class EOS no, they seriously
couldn’t, no-one could swim in our class apart from me EOS it’s like,
really bad, she’d right- ‘we’ll do front crawl’, and we all had to
like, be in the lanes cos, to like, our class was that small we had
one lane each EOS and no joke, she says, ‘do front crawl’, no one
could do it, they’ll do doggy paddle, she’s like, ‘ah, do backstroke’,
everyone could do backstroke apart from the ones who used to just kick
their legs EOS yeah, I know, your arm- EOS and then- EOS your arms
don’t really help with backstroke though, I don’t think EOS no, I
never see the point, and then erm, EOS you just always wet your face
and stuff EOS the breaststroke cou- no-one could- everyone could do
the arms, but then they didn’t do the legs EOS right, they just like
kicked their legs, EOS no, you don’t do, yeah EOS but if you don’t do
your legs right you co- it doesn’t work the same, cos you’re meant to
glide in the s- yeah EOS you see, yeah, I’m a geek really, and then
erm yeah, no-one could do butterfly apart from me, everyone used to
stand there and- EOS what’s butterfly? EOS the one where you go, pfff
EOS never even done that in my life EOS and you know that one that
you’ve gotta lie on your back but you’ve got to like go forward oh,
okay EOS no EOS it’s like the, yeah, it is, it’s like an unusual one,
and then we used to have to spin all the way down and then you used to
have to jump in the pool to extend your legs apparently, d- EOS could
you dive? EOS no, we weren’t allowed to EOS oh EOS I remember you did
a belly flop once, it was so funny EOS do you know what was the- were

used to be good EOS **inc** EOS and no-one ever wanted to go in the
deep end EOS I’ve never pl I was gonna, ah- I was gonna ask the most
stupid question then EOS go on EOS it wasn’t about the horses in water
polo anyway EOS I’m really confused EOS g- I couldn’t remember what it
was for a second I was like, ‘oh yeah, polo’s the one with the horses
isn’t it, how do horses play water polo’ yeah, that was a bit of a
stupid one EOS okay, wait
