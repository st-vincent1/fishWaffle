Yeah.... One two three.... That’s fine.... W-... One two three. Erm
yeah th- that’s fine.... Do you want my name?... Oh no that’s fine.
Erm you can start now-... Oh- right.... Whenever you’re ready. Thank
you.... Go on then. You start then dear.... Well do you r- .... What’s
her f-... Can you switch off if you don’t think it’s right? We were
both born and brought up in in Salford. Is that the-... Yeah that’s
fine.... Yep.... Erm you lived across- we-... I lived across the f-
there was a football pitch. I lived at one end and you-... And I- I
lived with my grandma and mum and dad. Erm and she had what they
called then a corner shop-... Oh.... which s- it sold everything.
Bread and milk and erm we lived with her because she’d just lost her
husband and bought this shop and erm my dad was a painter and
decorator and had a lot of out of work.... And he used to get three-
he-... He- he worked for himself. He had his own business.... He
didn’t then.... Oh no he didn’t **inc**... And he used to get three
pounds a week-... Wow.... to keep us all and he used to give it my
grandma. And in return he used to get a couple of packets of
cigarettes.... So erm you lived across.... I lived across yes- across
the pitch.... Erm and during the war, just after the war she used to
put cigarettes under the counter for you didn’t she?... **inc** I- I
didn’t smoke then but I erm- I worked as a erm motor mechanic and the
lads there, there was quite a lot of them smoked and you couldn’t get
cigarettes because they were under the counter.... Oh.... ‘Would you
go and ask your girlfriend’s grandma’ .... Erm would she let us have
some cigarettes. Which she used to like-... Mm, mm... let us have a
few packets now and again.... But erm I didn’t have any brothers and
sisters.... But there were lots and lots of children.... Mm.... And
erm we used to play outside on the erm pavement. There were no
gardens. It was just erm streets in . And erm we used to chalk the
flags and play hop-scotch and erm play ball against the wall. And erm
hide and seek in peoples’ doors and I have been known to knock on
doors and run away.... And I got a good smack off my mother for doing
that because she caught me. And erm we used to erm- we never went far
away from where we lived and everywhere was very safe. There was
no-... Mm.... no erm hint of any people-... Danger.... doing wrong
things to children.... Not like there is today.... There was nothing
like that.... Mm.... No.... Where I lived anyway. Erm as I say my
grandma had a shop.... Erm I can remember bread being four pence and
milk being four pence at the same time. And erm she used to have this
machine where she cut all the bacon up by hand with a machine that you
turned a handle. And she had loads of sweets in one window and I was
not allowed to touch them-... unless I asked her could I have some.
Now I was allowed but if I was caught taking any I got another smack
off me mother across my legs.... She was a very strict- yeah. B: And
it never ever did me any harm. Erm and I did have to help out in the
house because we used to stone the steps. We used to stone the step of
the shop and stone the window ledges of the house-... Mm **inc**....
all the way round. And stone the back steps-... The back yard yeah....
with a- a brown stone or a cream stone. And while I was doing it I was
told to do next door so I had to do those as well.... And erm what
about you? What did you do?... What did I do?... When you were young.
What did you play?... Well I used to pla- play a lot of football....
Yeah.... I used to love football and of course facing the house was
this big football pitch .... Which was horrible surface.... Which
was-... Oh was it?... int- in- incidentally- it wasn’t-... It was like
cinders.... I was a cinder pitch really. When you fell down it- it
used to take part of your knee cap off.... Ouch.... So constant-
constantly you had black marks on your knees... where the cinders had
gone in.... Mm.... And erm but I used to love playing football and erm
I used to also like repairing bicycles.... But what- also what did you
used to do? You used to go on the hills at which was near prison....
Oh no.... And what did you used to do there? You used to go swimming
in the-... Swimming in these-... horrible dirty filthy water....
Yeah.... When you think about it yes.... There was they were like erm
they were like big clay pits and they’d filled with water and we used
to go swimming in there. I’d- Many a time I’d cut my foot, my legs
because there was broken bottle-... Oh no.... There was old prams in
there.... Terrible when you think of it.... When I think about it
now.... I mean I wasn’t allowed.... Yeah.... I didn’t know this went
on until we started to go out as erm w- when I was about fifteen or
sixteen. Keith used to mend my bike and I used to go for chips for all
the erm-... All the- all the-... boys and girls that were all round on
the corner there.... But erm **inc**... But m- us best or funniest
memory was during the war and erm we used to go- w- we had a back yard
and it had a little garden ine itwith a beautiful tree in it. The
erm-... Oh erm th- what’s- the elderber-... elderflower tree....
Elderflower.... So we did have a bit of a- a little bit of garden but
this brick- they came and built these brick shelters. I can’t remember
w- w- how- the shelter being built.... But my dad made it very nice
inside with beds and we had erm some kind of a light in there and erm
my grandma would never ever come down when the air raids went....
Yeah.... And it was very frightening-... Mm.... and it must’ve been
very frightening for them but I was only nine, ten.... Mm.... And it-
to me it was a big adventure.... And one night my dad was a- an ARP
warden like you see on erm Dad’s Army.... And erm one night they
dropped all these incendiary bombs on this pitch at the back of our
house.... **inc** and they hit erm-... And erm-... the prison.... my
dad-... prison that night.... Oh.... My dad dragged the dustbin out
which in those days they were metal dustbins.... Mm.... He dragged it
outside and he said ‘come on Brenda and help me fill it with water
because w- we’re going to have to put all these fires out’. And I was
running backwards and forwards and passing him all this water. And erm
we put the light on.... And I said to him ‘daddy this water’s not
going- there’s no water in it’. And unfortunately in the- so it- to me
it’s very funny this.... We were dashing backwards and forwards with
this buckets of water and there was a big hole in the dustbin.... So
as fast as we were p-... ,... Putting the water in it was running
out.... putting the water in... Oh no... Yeah... So that to me is a- a
long- it’s- I mean it’s a long time ago and I remember that and it was
very funny.... And erm when these bombs these incendiary bombs dropped
they dropped one outside a lamp post. You used to have big lamp posts
in those days. I don’t know what- what were those lamp posts erm-...
They used to be gas.... Gas.... Gas lit.... Mm.... And erm m-... Well
they were, they were ga-... I’ve never seen my grandma come down the
stairs as quick.... She’d never ever got up. She used to stay in bed.
But she was down those stairs.... And one night me mother came out and
she’d got the budgie on her head.... Oh no .... So she had to t- and I
said m- I used to call her mammy ‘mammy’. The- I for- forget what the
bird was called.... ‘So and so’s on your head’. Sh- She turned quickly
back and went you know went back in the house so that was another
funny memory.... And erm- about parents-... Erm what I used to do was
erm when I think about it now I would never let my sons do that. But
erm I used to erm when the air raids were on-... Mm.... I used to go
out with a- a bucket and a pair of coal tongs and I’d be picking
shrapnel up.... Oh... You’d- you’d- you’d be s- listening ye- and
you’d hear it going ‘shhhhh’ down the road. And you could see it was
white hot. When I think that really that my parents let me go out-...
Mm.... picking the sh- the shrapnel-... Mm.... the pieces of shrapnel
up. I had buckets and buckets of it.... did you?... And we used to
swap it with one another you know. It- it- if it had got the German
erm- erm-... emblem on you used to erm swap it for something else....
Mm.... Incendiary bombs had the German mark on.... Mmhmm.... And
erm-... But as I say we were children. It was an adventure to us....
Yeah.... Erm I- I th- I thought it was great-... But can you imagine
if it happened now. I’d be absolutely-... Yeah.... Mm.... frightened
to death.... When you know what’s going on.... You would. It- it would
be a very frightening experience cos my mother was a very nervous
lady.... Yeah.... And she must’ve been absolutely frightened to
death.... Terrified yeah. But on this football pitch facing they dug
it all up and put the biggest air raid shelter you’ve ever seen on the
ground.... Really?... Yeah. And we used to go in there. It- it was
terrible. It was t-... Well I never went in.... Oh the- the smell....
My mother wouldn’t go in there so-... But we- we had a-... Mm.... one
built in the back erm- the back yard.... Yeah they built these
brick-... Brick solid-... They were very strong brick. I meant there
were different types of shelters.... Mm.... My auntie who lived in
Urmston she had one and it was called a Morrison and it was like a big
cage.... A- anderson ones. They-... Mm.... Just like a big cage. A
Morrison.... Oh that was the Morrison yes.... And erm she used to have
a lovely- a lovely embroidered cloth on it-... and flowers. And if the
sirens went she used to go under there with her husband. They had no
children. Erm and then there were the Anderson ones with people in the
garden. You used to go down into those.... Mm.... But erm m- there was
w- called a blitz. Erm it was a christmas blitz wasn’t it?... Yes that
was the biggest .... Nineteen forty- forty one. And my grandparents
lived in which is in- still in Salford. And when I think of it now
they wouldn’t have allowed a child but I was ten and my mother put me
on the bus where we lived-... mm.... to go and see- ‘go and see if
your grandma’s alright.’ And I went on my own you know th-... Mm....
it would be unheard of now wouldn’t it?... Yeah.... And erm when I got
there the street had been bombed-... It’d gone.... and all the houses
the curtains the windows were all blown out.... Oh.... And I stood at
the top of this street and I cried.... Mm.... And this man came to me
and he said ‘what’s the matter?’ and I said ‘I’ve come to see my
grandma and look at the house’. He said ‘don’t worry I’ll take you’.
They’ve taken them to th- what they called a rest centre and it was in
a church.... Church yeah.... And he took me there. Now in this day and
age I didn’t know the man.... Mm.... Well you know y-... when you
think. Erm there was no-... I think-... there was none of that
fear.... I think you were safer then than you are today.... Oh
yeah.... It’s-... I do really think so.... Y- you never heard of
people being murdered and stabbed and-... No no.... and like I say you
used- you used- you used to t- travel quite a way on your own didn’t
you?... Yes you did.... **inc** young. Going to school.... Oh yes. I
went to school. Was- **inc** yeah-... Which is quite a way from-... I
went to- I went to School. Before that I went to School and my mother
used to take me and bring me home four times a day.... Really?... She
used to take me in the morning. Come home. Come for me at lunchtime.
We used to go through a- and a park called Park which is still there.
Take me back. Then come for me back again in the afternoon.... And
then I went to School... and I used to walk there e- but if me mother
could afford it I used to go on the bus.... Mm.... And it was a g- a
long way from where I lived.... It was a long way yes.... So erm that
school isn’t there anymore School. It was called Bella Vista because
it was the consul at one time.... Yeah.... And it was a beautiful
house. It was really lovely. So erm and what do you remember from your
first day at school? I cried and cried-... and the Headmistress was
called and she said to my mother ‘leave her, she’ll be alright’ and I
sat at side on a chair for three weeks.... And she said to me mother
‘she’ll get fed up before I will’.... Mm.... So that was- I hated it
and I was very upset and eventually - I got very friendly with her and
she eventually erm persuaded me to go into the classroom .... No I
never got into trouble at school. I was quite a good child I think....
We- talking about holidays we erm w- never had any holidays. Th- th-
the erm-... oh switch it off.... That alright? Is that ok?... Yeah
that’s fine. Don’t worry.... Hello Telephone conversation omitted...
No thank you... They’ve got ten eight hundred and thirty four pound
vouchers to give out. So I don’t-... Sounds a bit odd.... oh, they’re
always sending me-... No I- I never had- I never went on holiday. The
only holiday I’ve ever had was-... You had a lot of brothers and
sisters.... I- I did.... I was an only child.... Yes I had erm four
brothers and one sister. And erm- but we never had holidays. Only days
out to Blackpool.... Mm.... But my- one of my brothers- I had four
half b- brothers. Step brothers. And erm he- he was a mechanic and erm
he- he- he used to do quite well and he said ‘if you save your spends
up’ which was about in today’s money about five p a week-... erm ‘you
can come away with me’ and he had a m- a car which in the- those days
was fantastic you know.... Mm.... If somebody had a motorcar-... Well
if you had a friend that was a car-... Yeah.... that had a car it was
absolutely marvellous. K: Well he had a car and erm and erm he- he
said ‘save your- save your spends up and I’ll take you erm away for a
week’. And he did and we w- went to Wales and when I was sat at- I can
see myself now sat in that car. And I- I was hoping all my friends
could see me -... yeah.... going away on holiday. And that was about
the best holiday I ever had then-... Mm.... as- as child cos I never
went away again after that. Like I say we used to go, **inc**... now
and again they’d take us to Blackpool on the train.... Mm.... For a
day. But erm that was it.... Well I went to Blackpool once a year for
a week. And what you did it was a- I forget what they called it. It
wasn’t self-catering but you bought the food and the person that you
were staying with erm she cooked it for you.... Th- th- they- c-
cooked it for you yeah.... Oh ok.... I don’t know what they called it
but th- they did a lot of that in those days and that street it’s or .
It’s still there in Blackpool and we went once a week- erm once a year
for a week. **inc** can I go- move onto that one?... Yeah,
whatever.... Yeah. Oh I did get hurt while- when I was playing as a
child. Like Keith said erm I fell on this what we called a rec. We
called it the rec didn’t we?... Yeah th- it was a- yeah we called it a
rec.... I- I- It was short for recreation ground... mm... but we
called it the rec and I fell on there.... Ooh and I had terrible
knees.... I had-... and erm-... I always had-... They were awful-...
and we’d gone to- my mother had bound them up and we’d gone to visit
me grandma who was a- she was a lovely lady and they lived in . And
she said ‘what’s she done?’ and my mother told her and she looked at
it and she said ‘get those bandages off’ because they’d all pussed
over.... Oh no.... She said erm ‘let it- let- get the air to them’. I
can always remember it and within a- a day they’d- they’d all dried
up. So -... I’ve always remembered that ever since . Your home town.
Shall we go onto home town?... Yeah you can do yeah.... A-... Do you
want me to talk or-... Yeah go on I’ll-... are you going to say where
were your parents from?... Oh parents from. Well erm my parents erm my
father worked at erm-... from , from .... Oh my- my- m- m- my erm
mother’s family originate from .... Oh okay.... That’s where erm-
that’s where they were erm born. But my father worked at Erm, which
was at Gorton. were locomotive engineers and he used to cy-... They
made the big steam trains you know.... Steam trains and that.... Oh
ok.... And he used to erm cycle from erm all the way to Gorton
every-... Wow.... and back again which is a heck of a way . Like I say
in- in regards to toys I’ve had very, very little toys. But my father
had some cowboys and indians made. He- he g- he got the erm the chaps
at work th- that make the erm moulds in- they made these erm moulds
for soldiers and cowboys and he- he made- he made them out of solid
lead. When you think now,... I used t- they weren’t painted when- and
I got them for Christmas and when I think I used to play with lead
soldiers .... Yeah .... You know which is really harmful for you. But
that was the only erm toys I had and I had them for years I was
playing with those.... My interests when I was a child, I’ve just seen
that there, erm was music. I learned to play the piano.... Oh.... And
erm I- I loved music in any- any form really.... Mm.... And I still
do. I still sing and erm we have a music group at church but of course
that’s- i- that’s lo- current at the moment but me parents, my father
was born in and my mother was born in erm- down erm in Salford in ....
Mm.... So erm I don’t know why me- me father came to live in Salford
but erm my mother’s never been anywhere- no she was born here.... And
erm I’ve got a picture of her when she was a little girl. So she’d-
she was born in nineteen hundred and two so it’s quite and old picture
.... yeah.... And if you ever want any old pictures I’ve got them....
Erm- erm we didn’t move house at all. Erm we went to live in that shop
as I say with my grandma and the next move we made was when she died
and they sold the house, my mother and father, and we went to live in
. We were still in Salford and erm Keith was in the army weren’t y-
nati- doing his national sh- service.... Yeah.... And erm we married
from the house in didn’t we.... Well I was in the army.... Yes he was
in the army.... Because erm- erm then i- it was a s- sergeant said to
me- he said- I told him that I was en- engaged-... Mm.... to be
married when I came out of the army. He said ‘well really you’d be
better marrying because you’ll get marriage allowance’.... Oh.... So
w- we arranged didn’t we-... Yes-... I’d been in the army about-...
and I was twenty one.... Yeah.... And y- Keith was twenty two when we
got married. Mm.... So we did erm get married-... Yeah.... and erm and
of course Brenda got the erm- the erm marriage allowance and saved it
up and we had a nice little nest egg didn’t we-... Mm.... when- when I
came out.... And that’s when I came up to from with a friend who was
looking at some houses erm on the front there, near .... Mm.... They
were building those semis r- just round the corner when you go towards
the Trafford Centre.... Yeah.... There’s some semis there-... Yeah....
and erm and she went to look at those and then we came to look at
these on and I liked these.... No we- we brought them up didn’t we and
y- your father’s-... No, no that was after.... Oh.... That was after.
No I brought erm I can’t remember her name now. No you weren’t very
friendly with her but then-... Mm.... I saw these and went back home
and told Keith and that’s- that’s when we came to live in .... In- in
th-... In this house in . Yeah.... Fifty five years ago.... Yeah....
Wow.... Mm.... Yeah.... Mm.... And we- we paid one thousand eight
hundred and fifty pounds.... No one thousand six hundred and fifty
pounds.... Oh one thousand six hundred and fifty pounds for it....
Sixteen hundred and fifty.... Amazing.... Eh. It’s amazing isn’t
it?... Yeah. It is.... But we brought a friend with us who was my son-
my eldest son’s godfather and they lived in . And he was a very astute
man and a very good man and a- we really were very fond of him. And he
came with us to look at them and my dad was very much against us
buying it. He said ‘you’ve got a milstone round your neck’. That’s
what he said.... But we were very happy living with your parents....
Oh yes-... They had that big house in and-... we were very, very
happy. And erm my mother- and he- my mother thought the world of Keith
and he thought the world of her. Erm but erm this friend of ours came
to talk me dad round to say that he had bought his house and it was
three hundred and forty pounds.... And that was-... And that was a
milstone round their neck but it wasn’t anymore.... No.... And he said
eventually it will be beneficial to them. So that’s- he talked my dad
round and-... Well the thing was you could rent a house then....
Mm.... You could rent houses.... Mm.... There was- there was plenty to
rent.... Mm.... I mean not like n- not like today.... But we just
liked these houses. We thought they were absolutely lovely and erm m-
m- what it- what was it we hadn’t got money for? Erm-... Oh the
erm-... and my dad lent us the twenty five pounds.... we didn’t have
the money for the erm the rest of the money for the deposit.... Mm....
It was a hundred pound deposit.... Mm.... We’d paid forty but there
was sixty outstanding and w- we k- kept coming round and having a look
and it’s- once they got the roof on they wanted the balance.... Mm....
Oh.... And I thought- the came and they’d got the roof on.... And by
the Keith wasn’t a mechanic. He was working for me father who was a
painter and decorator and you had to have e- eleven pounds a week
wages. They wouldn’t take the wife then.... Oh.... It was just the
husband it-... you know if you were working that didn’t matter.... And
I was earning ten pounds.... And he was earning ten and me- my dad
said to Keith ‘well tell them you’re earning eleven but I can’t afford
to give you that’.... so... And he- he lent us the money for the
erm-... Yeah.... the balance.... But when you think of those
figures.... Yeah.... I know.... But you see it just- it goes on and
on.... Yeah it does.... I meant when- when you get older you’ll think
well fancy those prices that we paid then.... Yeah.... So erm yeah.
Erm in your opinion how has the community changed in recent years?
Well I think it changed tr- tremendously. Tremendously. There’s a lot
of terrible things happen now that I don’t think did happen then.
Children are- are not safe anymore like they used to be. And erm-...
You can’t afford to take your eyes off them can you.... and everything
is so expensive to take them anywhere.... Mm.... I mean my son has
just been away with four and he said when you go in a- just for a
coffee.... It’s six coff- well five coffees or five drinks.... Mm....
And it’s so expensive isn’t it.... Yeah.... But erm everything has-
has really gone up in price.... The most important changes have taken
place in your town.... Mm well-... Well when we came round here from
erm- from we thought we were coming to live in the country-... In the
country.... Right.... It was beautiful.... It was so quiet-... Mm....
and erm-... Mm.... You could park anywhere in Urmston and erm- but now
I think it’s-... And we liked Urmston as it was.... It- well w- we did
yeah.... But I mean now I think they’ve just made a mess of it....
Mm.... because it’s part finished and-... Yeah.... and they’re not
saying- they’re saying until they- I think they- somebody said that
they’ve run out of money the developers.... Yeah I think they have....
And erm- so it’s just a mess I think.... I think they expected more
people to erm buy those apartments-... I think-... in the centre, but
then-... Yeah and they haven’t done. No.... No.... No. No they
haven’t. And I think they’re the ugliest looking things.... Yep... We
only said the other day look at all that horrible wood.... **inc**
timber.... Mm.... Where’s the design in that?... I know.... **inc**
it’s not-... And then of course a build-up of erm- I’m not objecting
to the Trafford Centre but the Chill Factor and erm all these big
things that keep going up. It’s just lost it’s erm I don’t know,
prettiness really. It used to be a pretty village more or less
Davyhulme. And I know things have got to progress but I don’t- I hate
all these great big things that are going up.... Yeah.... And erm I
don’t know. Local people-... but we remember the first erm-... We
remember the-... shopping centre being built in Urmston.... Yeah....
The precinct there.... Yeah.... And it was nice.... It was nice
before.... It was a nice precinct that.... It- no it was nice before
that they did that I thought.... Mm mm.... It was quite quaint. I’ve
s- I’ve got loads of pictures of that.... Mm.... How it used to be .
But erm-... But I do think there’s a lot of community things happening
now like erm the man that owns that .... Yeah.... Now f- I think it’s
the third year now that he’s put this community erm-... The summer-...
sort of a carnival type thing hasn’t he.... Yeah.... In the grammar
school gardens and I think- we went because my granddaughters were
dancing.... Ah.... They go to .... Mm.... And they were doing this
dancing group and we went to watch them and I just thought it was
lovely.... Yeah.... Yes.... All the people- local people all mingling
with one another.... Mmhmm... And I really- I r- it really uplifted me
to see them all having a good time and there was no trouble....
Yeah.... Erm and I think the community spirit here is better and hope
it will get better.... Mm.... Erm the carnival on Saturday- there’s
the carnival on Saturday and for the first time there’s erm an
ecumenical church tent being erected.... Right.... And they’re giving
free teas and cakes. In fact we’re involved with it.... Mm.... And
it’s the first time they’ve done that and erm hope- hopefully well
they will be telling people all about the things that go on in all the
churches. Hopefully we might get a few more people to come....
Yeah.... But it’s still a community thing and I think-... Gets people
together yeah.... it’s a good thing for the community... Mmhmm... Yeah
I li- I-... Yeah and erm there’s not really- when you look at the
television and see all the horrible things that happen in other towns.
I don’t know I’ve never heard of anything horrible -... No I
haven’t... happening in Urmston at night.... No.... So I just hope
that erm- there’s- I think there’s quite a long of thing to ha- to do
in this community if you’re willing to erm-... you know different erm-
erm what- what can I call them, different groups. So you needn’t be
bored. There’s lots to do really.... Yeah.... If you go out and look
for it. What’s your- do you agree with me? You see-... Yes I d-...
we’re very involved in church so I’ve always got something to do....
Mm.... I mean I’m going out tonight. No I’m going out tomorrow and erm
going out next week all the meetings start so I’ll be out about three
nights a week which is erm- is very good.... Mm.... Mm. Right ....
**inc** erm- erm.... I think it’s very sad that erm TJ Hughes has gone
from Stretford.... Yeah.... I think it’ll be a- make a big difference
to Stretford erm- erm town centre. Erm cos I like- I like that erm
shopping precinct. It’s pleasant and it’s warm and-... Mm.... erm it’s
somewhere for people to meet. I don’t know what’s going to happen
there.... Did you ever get into trouble at school? Going back a bit
now aren’t I really.... Does it matter?... No of course it doesn’t....
No it doesn’t matter? Yep .... Did you get into trouble? I didn’t-...
Yeah- oh no you didn’t, no.... I was perfect... Hey we- we used to c-
I went to School first and from there I went to school, . And on the
way home from when we were at erm-... erm the erm- we used to pass
this house that had a cherry tree hanging over the wall. And ev-
everyday you passed it seemed to get redder and redder these cherries
and me and my friends one day we thought I think we’ll have some of
those .... And we climbed on the wall and just pulled a little bunch
down and we both had one each. And they were horrible.... oh no....
But we didn’t- unknown to us there was policeman behind us who grabbed
us... and took us back to school. And erm the next morning we had to
come out in front of the- all the assembly and the pair of us were
brought out to the front and- and the teacher erm- the teacher said-
the Headteacher said I’d have- we’d have to go to his room after and
of course we were- our heads down and we both got the cane on both
hands. And when we used to walk past that house with those cherry
trees... we used to have our hands in our pockets .... Mm.... Yeah
well I think there again- I think it’s gone from the sublime to the
ridiculous.... Yes you’re not allowed to touch-... Because I think
it’s digusting now that children have got no respect-... Mm.... for
policemen and really a lot of them have not got any respect for
anybody.... Anybody. No.... And they try and blame everybody bar the
parents.... I know. The riots were terrible weren’t they.... Oh
that-... Oh that was terrible. Well what’s uplifted me was the m- the
all those young people going in and cleaning up.... Yeah.... Yes.... I
thought that was wonderful... Yeah. That was brilliant.... And some of
them looked- I thought golly you’d-... yeah.... You know so you can’t
tell by how people look.... No you’re right.... No.... But I do think
it’s erm you know that being allowed to throw stones at policemen. I
was frightened to death of policemen.... Oh yes. Y-... I- that was
silly but I’d rather it be like that-... Mm.... than like it is now. I
mean policemen are there to erm to keep-... To protect the-... to
protect people-... protect the public. Yeah th-... and the public....
And they get a terrible lot of bad pub- publicity.... Yeah.... And I
know maybe there are some sadistic policemen but most of them are very
