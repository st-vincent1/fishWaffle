 One two three. EOS One two three. Erm yeah th- that’s fine. EOS Do
you want my name? EOS Oh no that’s fine. Erm you can start now- EOS
Whenever you’re ready. Thank you. EOS Go on then. You start then dear.
EOS Well do you r- . EOS What’s her f- EOS Can you switch off if you
don’t think it’s right? We were both born up in **anon** in Salford.
Is that the- EOS Yeah that’s fine. EOS Erm you lived across- we- EOS I
lived across the f- there was a football pitch. I lived at one end EOS
And I- I lived with my grandma and mum and dad. Erm and she had what
called then a corner shop- EOS which s- it sold everything. Bread and
milk and erm we lived with her she’d just lost her husband and bought
this shop and erm my dad was a and decorator and had a lot of out of
work. EOS And he used to get three- he- EOS He- he worked for himself.
He had his own business. EOS He didn’t then. EOS Oh no he didn’t EOS
And he used to get three pounds a week- EOS to keep us all and he used
to give it my grandma. And in return he used to get a couple of
packets of cigarettes. EOS So erm you lived across. EOS I lived across
yes- across the pitch. EOS Erm and during the war, just after the war
she used to put cigarettes counter for you didn’t she? EOS I- I didn’t
smoke then but I erm- I worked as a erm motor mechanic and the lads
there, there was quite a lot of them smoked and you couldn’t get
because they were under the counter. EOS ‘Would you go and ask your
girlfriend’s grandma’ . EOS Erm would she let us have some cigarettes.
Which she used to like- EOS let us have a few packets now and again.
EOS But erm I didn’t have any brothers and sisters. EOS But there were
lots and lots of children. EOS And erm we used to play outside on the
erm pavement. There were no It was just erm streets in **anon**. And
erm we used to chalk the flags play hop-scotch and erm play ball
against the wall. And erm hide and peoples’ doors and I have been
known to knock on doors and run away. EOS And I got a good smack off
my mother for doing that because she And erm we used to erm- we never
went far away from where we lived everywhere was very safe. There was
no- EOS no erm hint of any people- EOS doing wrong things to children.
EOS Not like there is today. EOS There was nothing like that. EOS
Where I lived anyway. Erm as I say my grandma had a shop. EOS Erm I
can remember bread being four pence and milk being four pence same
time. And erm she used to have this machine where she cut all up by
hand with a machine that you turned a handle. And she had loads sweets
in one window and I was not allowed to touch them- EOS unless I asked
her could I have some. Now I was allowed but if I was taking any I got
another smack off me mother across my legs. EOS She was a very strict-
yeah. B: And it never ever did me any harm. Erm and I did have to help
out in because we used to stone the steps. We used to stone the step
of the stone the window ledges of the house- EOS all the way round.
And stone the back steps- EOS The back yard yeah. EOS with a- a brown
stone or a cream stone. And while I was doing it I was told to do
**anon** next door so I had to do those as well. EOS And erm what
about you? What did you do? EOS What did I do? EOS When you were
young. What did you play? EOS Well I used to pla- play a lot of
football. EOS I used to love football and of course facing the house
was this big EOS Which was horrible surface. EOS Oh was it? EOS int-
in- incidentally- it wasn’t- EOS It was like cinders. EOS I was a
cinder pitch really. When you fell down it- it used to take part of
your knee cap off. EOS So constant- constantly you had black marks on
your knees cinders had gone in. EOS And erm but I used to love playing
football and erm I used to also EOS But what- also what did you used
to do? You used to go on the hills at **anon** which was near **anon**
prison. EOS And what did you used to do there? You used to go swimming
in the- EOS Swimming in these- EOS horrible dirty filthy water. EOS
When you think about it yes. EOS There was they were like erm they
were like big clay pits filled with water and we used to go swimming
in there. I’d- Many a time I’d cut my foot, my legs because there was
broken bottle- EOS There was old prams in there. EOS Terrible when you
think of it. EOS When I think about it now. EOS I mean I wasn’t
allowed. EOS I didn’t know this went on until we started to go out as
erm w- when I was about fifteen or sixteen. Keith **anon** used to
mend my bike and I used to go for chips for all the erm- EOS All the-
all the- EOS boys and girls that were all round on the corner there.
EOS But m- us best or funniest memory was during the war and erm we
used w- we had a back yard and it had a little garden ine itwith a
beautiful tree in it. The EOS Oh erm th- what’s- the elderber- EOS So
we did have a bit of a- a little bit of garden but this brick- they
came and built these brick shelters. I can’t remember w- w- how- the
shelter being EOS But my dad made it very nice inside with beds and we
had erm some kind of a light in there and erm my grandma would never
ever come down when the air raids went. EOS And it was very
frightening- EOS and it must’ve been very frightening for them but I
was only nine, EOS And it- to me it was a big adventure. EOS And one
night my dad was a- an ARP warden like you see on erm Dad’s EOS And
erm one night they dropped all these incendiary bombs on this pitch at
the back of our house. EOS and they hit erm- EOS **anon** prison that
night. EOS My dad dragged the dustbin out which in those days they
were metal EOS He dragged it outside and he said ‘come on Brenda
**anon** and help me with water because w- we’re going to have to put
all these fires out’. And I was running backwards and forwards and
passing him all this water. And erm we put the light on. EOS And I
said to him ‘daddy this water’s not going- there’s no water in
unfortunately in the- so it- to me it’s very funny this. EOS We were
dashing backwards and forwards with this buckets of water and was a
big hole in the dustbin. EOS So as fast as we were p- EOS Putting the
water in it was running out. EOS putting the water in EOS So that to
me is a- a long- it’s- I mean it’s a long time ago and I and it was
very funny. EOS And erm when these bombs these incendiary bombs
dropped they dropped outside a lamp post. You used to have big lamp
posts in those days. I what- what were those lamp posts erm- EOS They
used to be gas. EOS And erm m- EOS Well they were, they were ga- EOS
I’ve never seen my grandma come down the stairs as quick. EOS She’d
never ever got up. She used to stay in bed. But she was down EOS And
one night me mother came out and she’d got the budgie on her EOS Oh no
. EOS So she had to t- and I said m- I used to call her mammy ‘mammy’.
The- forget what the bird was called. EOS ‘So and so’s on your head’.
Sh- She turned quickly back and went you went back in the house so
that was another funny memory. EOS And erm- about parents- EOS Erm
what I used to do was erm when I think about it now I never let my
sons do that. But erm I used to erm when the air raids were EOS I used
to go out with a- a bucket and a pair of coal tongs and I’d be picking
shrapnel up. EOS You’d- you’d- you’d be s- listening ye- and you’d
hear it going down the road. And you could see it was white hot. When
I think that really that my parents let me go out- EOS picking the sh-
the shrapnel- EOS the pieces of shrapnel up. I had buckets and buckets
of it. EOS And we used to swap it with one another you know. It- it-
if it had German erm- erm- EOS emblem on you used to erm swap it for
something else. EOS Incendiary bombs had the German mark on. EOS But
as I say we were children. It was an adventure to us. EOS Erm I- I th-
I thought it was great- EOS But can you imagine if it happened now.
I’d be absolutely- EOS frightened to death. EOS When you know what’s
going on. EOS You would. It- it would be a very frightening experience
cos my mother was a very nervous lady. EOS And she must’ve been
absolutely frightened to death. EOS Terrified yeah. But on this
football pitch facing they dug it all up and put the biggest air raid
shelter you’ve ever seen on the ground. EOS Yeah. And we used to go in
there. It- it was terrible. It was t- EOS Well I never went in. EOS Oh
the- the smell. EOS My mother wouldn’t go in there so- EOS But we- we
had a- EOS one built in the back erm- the back yard. EOS Yeah they
built these brick- EOS They were very strong brick. I meant there were
different types of EOS My auntie who lived in Urmston she had one and
it was called a Morrison and it was like a big cage. EOS A- anderson
ones. They- EOS Just like a big cage. A Morrison. EOS Oh that was the
Morrison yes. EOS And erm she used to have a lovely- a lovely
embroidered cloth on it- EOS and flowers. And if the sirens went she
used to go under there with They had no children. Erm and then there
were the Anderson ones with in the garden. You used to go down into
those. EOS But erm m- there was w- called a blitz. Erm it was a
christmas blitz EOS Yes that was the biggest . EOS Nineteen forty-
forty one. And my grandparents lived in **anon** which in- still in
Salford. And when I think of it now they wouldn’t have child but I was
ten and my mother put me on the bus where we lived- EOS to go and see-
‘go and see if your grandma’s alright.’ And I went on my own you EOS
it would be unheard of now wouldn’t it? EOS And erm when I got there
the street had been bombed- EOS and all the houses the curtains the
windows were all blown out. EOS And I stood at the top of this street
and I cried. EOS And this man came to me and he said ‘what’s the
matter?’ and I said to see my grandma and look at the house’. He said
‘don’t worry I’ll They’ve taken them to th- what they called a rest
centre and it was in a church. EOS And he took me there. Now in this
day and age I didn’t know the man. EOS Well you know y- EOS when you
think. Erm there was no- EOS there was none of that fear. EOS I think
you were safer then than you are today. EOS I do really think so. EOS
Y- you never heard of people being murdered and stabbed and- EOS and
like I say you used- you used- you used to t- travel quite a way on
your own EOS Yes you did. EOS young. Going to school. EOS Oh yes. I
went to **anon** school. Was- yeah- EOS Which is quite a way from- EOS
I went to- I went to **anon** School. Before that I went to **anon**
School and my mother used to take me and bring me home four times a
EOS She used to take me in the morning. Come home. Come for me at
lunchtime. We used to go through a- and a park called **anon** Park
which is still there. Take me back. Then come for me back again in the
EOS And then I went to **anon** School EOS and I used to walk there e-
but if me mother could afford it I used to go on the bus. EOS And it
was a g- a long way from where I lived. EOS It was a long way yes. EOS
So erm that school isn’t there anymore **anon** School. It was called
Bella Vista because it was the **anon** consul at one time. EOS And it
was a beautiful house. It was really lovely. So erm and what do you
remember from your first day at school? I cried and cried- EOS and the
Headmistress was called **anon** and she said to my mother ‘leave her,
she’ll be alright’ and I sat at **anon** side on a chair for EOS And
she said to me mother ‘she’ll get fed up before I will’. EOS So that
was- I hated it and I was very upset and eventually **anon**- I got
very friendly with her and she eventually erm persuaded me to go into
the classroom . EOS No I never got into trouble at school. I was quite
a good child I EOS We- talking about holidays we erm w- never had any
holidays. Th- th- the erm- EOS oh switch it off. EOS That alright? Is
that ok? EOS Yeah that’s fine. Don’t worry. Telephone conversation
omitted EOS No thank you EOS They’ve got ten eight hundred and thirty
four pound vouchers to give out. So I don’t- EOS Sounds a bit odd. EOS
oh, they’re always sending me- EOS No I- I never had- I never went on
holiday. The only holiday I’ve ever had was- EOS You had a lot of
brothers and sisters. EOS I- I did. EOS I was an only child. EOS Yes I
had erm four brothers and one sister. And erm- but we never had
holidays. Only days out to Blackpool. EOS But my- one of my brothers-
I had four half b- brothers. Step brothers. And erm he- he was a
mechanic and erm he- he- he used to do quite well and he said ‘if you
save your spends up’ which was about in today’s money about five p a
week- EOS erm ‘you can come away with me’ and he had a m- a car which
in the- those days was fantastic you know. EOS If somebody had a
motorcar- EOS Well if you had a friend that was a car- EOS that had a
car it was absolutely marvellous. K: Well he had a car and erm and erm
he- he said ‘save your- save your spends up and I’ll take you erm away
for a week’. And he did and we w- went to Wales and when I was sat at-
I can see myself now sat in that car. And I- I was hoping all my
friends could see me EOS going away on holiday. And that was about the
best holiday I ever had then- EOS as- as child cos I never went away
again after that. Like I say we used to go, EOS now and again they’d
take us to Blackpool on the train. EOS For a day. But erm that was it.
EOS Well I went to Blackpool once a year for a week. And what you did
it was a- I forget what they called it. It wasn’t self-catering but
you bought the food and the person that you were staying with erm she
cooked it for you. EOS Th- th- they- c- cooked it for you yeah. EOS I
don’t know what they called it but th- they did a lot of that in those
days and that street it’s **anon** or **anon**. It’s still there in
Blackpool and we went once a week- erm once a year for a week. can I
go- move onto that one? EOS Yeah. Oh I did get hurt while- when I was
playing as a child. Like Keith **anon** said erm I fell on this what
we called a rec. We called it the rec didn’t we? EOS Yeah th- it was
a- yeah we called it a rec. EOS I- I- It was short for recreation
ground EOS but we called it the rec and I fell on there. EOS Ooh and I
had terrible knees. EOS I always had- EOS They were awful- EOS and
we’d gone to- my mother had bound them up and we’d gone to visit me
grandma who was a- she was a lovely lady and they lived in **anon**.
And she said ‘what’s she done?’ and my mother told her and she looked
at it and she said ‘get those bandages off’ because they’d all pussed
EOS She said erm ‘let it- let- get the air to them’. I can always
remember it and within a- a day they’d- they’d all dried up. So EOS
I’ve always remembered that ever since . Your home town. Shall we go
onto home town? EOS Yeah you can do yeah. EOS Do you want me to talk
or- EOS Yeah go on I’ll- EOS are you going to say where were your
parents from? EOS Oh parents from. Well erm my parents erm my father
worked at EOS from **anon**, from **anon**. EOS Oh my- my- m- m- my
erm mother’s family originate from **anon**. EOS That’s where erm-
that’s where they were erm born. But my father Erm, **anon** which was
at Gorton. **anon** were locomotive engineers and he used to cy- EOS
They made the big steam trains you know. EOS Steam trains and that.
EOS And he used to erm cycle from erm **anon** all the way to Gorton
every- EOS and back again which is a heck of a way . Like I say in- in
regards to toys I’ve had very, very little toys. But my father had
some cowboys and indians made. He- he g- he got the erm the chaps at
work th- that make the erm moulds in- they made these erm moulds for
soldiers and cowboys and he- he made- he made them out of solid lead.
When you think now, EOS I used t- they weren’t painted when- and I got
them for Christmas and when I think I used to play with lead soldiers
. EOS You know which is really harmful for you. But that was the only
erm toys I had and I had them for years I was playing with those. EOS
My interests when I was a child, I’ve just seen that there, erm was
music. I learned to play the piano. EOS And erm I- I loved music in
any- any form really. EOS And I still do. I still sing and erm we have
a music group at church but of course that’s- i- that’s lo- current at
the moment but me parents, my father was born in **anon** and my
mother was born in erm- down erm in Salford in **anon**. EOS So erm I
don’t know why me- me father came to live in Salford but erm my
mother’s never been anywhere- no she was born here. EOS And erm I’ve
got a picture of her when she was a little girl. So she’d- she was
born in nineteen hundred and two so it’s quite and old EOS And if you
ever want any old pictures I’ve got them. EOS Erm- erm we didn’t move
house at all. Erm we went to live in that shop as I say with my
grandma and the next move we made was when she died and they sold the
house, my mother and father, and we went to live in **anon**. We were
still in Salford and erm Keith **anon** was in the army weren’t y-
nati- doing his national sh- service. EOS And erm we married from the
house in **anon** didn’t we. EOS Well I was in the army. EOS Yes he
was in the army. EOS Because erm- erm then i- it was a s- sergeant
said to me- he said- I told him that I was en- engaged- EOS to be
married when I came out of the army. He said ‘well really you’d be
better marrying because you’ll get marriage allowance’. EOS So w- we
arranged didn’t we- EOS I’d been in the army about- EOS and I was
twenty one. EOS And y- Keith **anon** was twenty two when we got
married. Mm. EOS So we did erm get married- EOS and erm and of course
Brenda **anon** got the erm- the erm marriage allowance and saved it
up and we had a nice little nest egg EOS when- when I came out. EOS
And that’s when I came up to **anon** from **anon** with a friend who
was looking at some houses erm on the front there, near **anon**. EOS
They were building those semis r- just round the corner when you go
towards the Trafford Centre. EOS There’s some semis there- EOS and erm
**anon** and she went to look at those and then we came to look at
these on **anon** and I liked these. EOS No we- we brought them up
didn’t we and y- your father’s- EOS No, no that was after. EOS That
was after. No I brought erm I can’t remember her name now. No you
weren’t very friendly with her but then- EOS I saw these and went back
home and told Keith **anon** and that’s- that’s when we came to live
in **anon**. EOS In- in th- EOS In this house in **anon**. Yeah. EOS
Fifty five years ago. EOS And we- we paid one thousand eight hundred
and fifty pounds. EOS No one thousand six hundred and fifty pounds.
EOS Oh one thousand six hundred and fifty pounds for it. EOS Sixteen
hundred and fifty. EOS Eh. It’s amazing isn’t it? EOS Yeah. It is. EOS
But we brought a friend with us who was my son- my eldest son’s
godfather and they lived in **anon**. And he was a very astute man and
a very good man and a- we really were very fond of him. And he came
with us to look at them and my dad was very much against us buying it.
He said ‘you’ve got a milstone round your neck’. That’s what he said.
EOS But we were very happy living with your parents. EOS They had that
big house in **anon** and- EOS we were very, very happy. And erm my
mother- and he- my mother thought the world of Keith **anon** and he
thought the world of her. Erm but erm **anon** this friend of ours
came to talk me dad round to say that he had bought his house and it
was three hundred and forty EOS And that was- EOS And that was a
milstone round their neck but it wasn’t anymore. EOS And he said
eventually it will be beneficial to them. So that’s- he talked my dad
round and- EOS Well the thing was you could rent a house then. EOS You
could rent houses. EOS There was- there was plenty to rent. EOS I mean
not like n- not like today. EOS But we just liked these houses. We
thought they were absolutely lovely and erm m- m- what it- what was it
we hadn’t got money for? Erm- EOS Oh the erm- EOS and my dad lent us
the twenty five pounds. EOS we didn’t have the money for the erm the
rest of the money for the EOS It was a hundred pound deposit. EOS We’d
paid forty but there was sixty outstanding and w- we k- kept coming
round and having a look and it’s- once they got the roof on they
wanted the balance. EOS And I thought- the came and they’d got the
roof on. EOS And by the Keith **anon** wasn’t a mechanic. He was
working for me father who was a painter and decorator and you had to
have e- eleven pounds a week wages. They wouldn’t take the wife then.
EOS It was just the husband it- EOS you know if you were working that
didn’t matter. EOS And I was earning ten pounds. EOS And he was
earning ten and me- my dad said to Keith **anon** ‘well tell them
you’re earning eleven but I can’t afford to give you that’. EOS And
he- he lent us the money for the erm- EOS But when you think of those
figures. EOS But you see it just- it goes on and on. EOS Yeah it does.
EOS I meant when- when you get older you’ll think well fancy those
prices that we paid then. EOS So erm yeah. Erm in your opinion how has
the community changed in recent years? Well I think it changed tr-
tremendously. Tremendously. There’s a lot of terrible things happen
now that I don’t think did happen then. Children are- are not safe
anymore like they used to be. EOS You can’t afford to take your eyes
off them can you. EOS and everything is so expensive to take them
anywhere. EOS I mean my son has just been away with four and he said
when you go in a- just for a coffee. EOS It’s six coff- well five
coffees or five drinks. EOS And it’s so expensive isn’t it. EOS But
erm everything has- has really gone up in price. EOS The most
important changes have taken place in your town. EOS Well when we came
round here from erm- from **anon** we thought we were coming to live
in the country- EOS In the country. EOS It was beautiful. EOS It was
so quiet- EOS You could park anywhere in Urmston and erm- but now I
think it’s- EOS And we liked Urmston as it was. EOS It- well w- we did
yeah. EOS But I mean now I think they’ve just made a mess of it. EOS
because it’s part finished and- EOS and they’re not saying- they’re
saying until they- I think they- somebody said that they’ve run out of
money the developers. EOS Yeah I think they have. EOS And erm- so it’s
just a mess I think. EOS I think they expected more people to erm buy
those apartments- EOS in the centre, but then- EOS Yeah and they
haven’t done. No. EOS No. No they haven’t. And I think they’re the
ugliest looking things. EOS We only said the other day look at all
that horrible wood. EOS Where’s the design in that? EOS And then of
course a build-up of erm- I’m not objecting to the Trafford Centre but
the Chill Factor and erm all these big things that keep going up. It’s
just lost it’s erm I don’t know, prettiness really. It used to be a
pretty village more or less Davyhulme. And I know things have got to
progress but I don’t- I hate all these great big things that are going
up. EOS And erm I don’t know. Local people- EOS but we remember the
first erm- EOS We remember the- EOS shopping centre being built in
Urmston. EOS The precinct there. EOS And it was nice. EOS It was nice
before. EOS It was a nice precinct that. EOS It- no it was nice before
that they did that I thought. EOS It was quite quaint. I’ve s- I’ve
got loads of pictures of that. EOS How it used to be . But erm- EOS
But I do think there’s a lot of community things happening now like
erm the man that owns **anon** that **anon**. EOS Now f- I think it’s
the third year now that he’s put this community EOS sort of a carnival
type thing hasn’t he. EOS In the grammar school gardens and I think-
we went because my granddaughters were dancing. EOS They go to
**anon**. EOS And they were doing this dancing group and we went to
watch them and I just thought it was lovely. EOS All the people- local
people all mingling with one another. EOS And I really- I r- it really
uplifted me to see them all having a good time and there was no
trouble. EOS Erm and I think the community spirit here is better and
hope it will EOS Erm the carnival on Saturday- there’s the carnival on
Saturday and for the first time there’s erm an ecumenical church tent
being EOS And they’re giving free teas and cakes. In fact we’re
involved with EOS And it’s the first time they’ve done that and erm
hope- hopefully well they will be telling people all about the things
that go on in all the churches. Hopefully we might get a few more
people to come. EOS But it’s still a community thing and I think- EOS
Gets people together yeah. EOS it’s a good thing for the community EOS
Yeah I li- I- EOS Yeah and erm there’s not really- when you look at
the television and see all the horrible things that happen in other
towns. I don’t know I’ve never heard of anything horrible - EOS No I
haven’t EOS happening in Urmston at night. EOS So I just hope that
erm- there’s- I think there’s quite a long of thing to ha- to do in
this community if you’re willing to erm- EOS you know different erm-
erm what- what can I call them, different groups. So you needn’t be
bored. There’s lots to do really. EOS If you go out and look for it.
What’s your- do you agree with me? You see- EOS Yes I d- EOS we’re
very involved in church so I’ve always got something to do. EOS I mean
I’m going out tonight. No I’m going out tomorrow and erm going out
next week all the meetings start so I’ll be out about three nights a
week which is erm- is very good. EOS Mm. Right . EOS I think it’s very
sad that erm TJ Hughes has gone from Stretford. EOS I think it’ll be
a- make a big difference to Stretford erm- erm town centre. Erm cos I
like- I like that erm shopping precinct. It’s pleasant and it’s warm
and- EOS erm it’s somewhere for people to meet. I don’t know what’s
going to happen there. EOS Did you ever get into trouble at school?
Going back a bit now aren’t EOS Does it matter? EOS No of course it
doesn’t. EOS No it doesn’t matter? Yep . EOS Did you get into trouble?
I didn’t- EOS Yeah- oh no you didn’t, no. EOS I was perfect EOS Hey
we- we used to c- I went to **anon** School first and from there I
went to **anon** school, **anon**. And on the way home from when we
were EOS erm **anon** the erm- we used to pass this house that had a
cherry tree hanging over the wall. And ev- everyday you passed it
seemed to get redder and redder these cherries and me and my friends
one day we thought I think we’ll have some of those . EOS And we
climbed on the wall and just pulled a little bunch down and we both
had one each. And they were horrible. EOS But we didn’t- unknown to us
there was policeman behind us who EOS and took us back to school. And
erm the next morning we had to come out in front of the- all the
assembly and the pair of us were brought out to the front and- and the
teacher erm- the teacher said- the Headteacher said I’d have- we’d
have to go to his room after and of course we were- our heads down and
we both got the cane on both hands. And when we used to walk past that
house with those cherry EOS we used to have our hands in our pockets .
EOS Yeah well I think there again- I think it’s gone from the sublime
to EOS Yes you’re not allowed to touch- EOS Because I think it’s
digusting now that children have got no respect- EOS for policemen and
really a lot of them have not got any respect for EOS And they try and
blame everybody bar the parents. EOS I know. The riots were terrible
weren’t they. EOS Oh that was terrible. Well what’s uplifted me
**anon** was the m- the all those young people going in and cleaning
up. EOS I thought that was wonderful EOS Yeah. That was brilliant. EOS
And some of them looked- I thought golly you’d- EOS You know so you
can’t tell by how people look. EOS No you’re right. EOS But I do think
it’s erm you know that being allowed to throw stones at policemen. I
was frightened to death of policemen. EOS Oh yes. Y- EOS I- that was
silly but I’d rather it be like that- EOS than like it is now. I mean
policemen are there to erm to keep- EOS To protect the- EOS to protect
people- EOS protect the public. Yeah th- EOS and the public. EOS And
they get a terrible lot of bad pub- publicity. EOS And I know maybe
there are some sadistic policemen but most of them are very good and
decent men. EOS And erm I just think it’s awful that children should
be taught to have more respect. EOS Erm and I still blame the parents
for a lot of these children. EOS Yes it’s sad really. I- EOS And I
think a lot of these children as well are from broken homes and
they’re living in erm social erm- erm they’re- they’re under the care
of the erm- Trafford. EOS And erm I’ve heard reports that they just
run wild and you’re not allowed to touch them. You’re not- if- they
know that if you touch them they can report you. EOS And I mean I used
