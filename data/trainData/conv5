... Yeah. Can you just count to three please.... One, two, three....
Yeah. Ok that’s great. When you’re ready.... Ok Arnold . I’ll kick
off- we’ll kick off with you shall we?... What?... Your best or
funniest memory.... Best or funniest memory from when I was young....
When you were young.... Erm-... Can you remember that far back?... w-
h- how young are we talking about here?... Well-... Very young....
Again it depends really on how far back you can remember .... Yeah, I
think the best- probably the best memory I have of- of being young is-
is Christmas time when all the family used to get together in those
days we- we always had all our aunts and uncles and cousins round on
Christmas day and-... Yeah.... and erm- we- w- there wasn’t an awful
lot of money but erm we used to have quite a big s- slap up meal at
lunchtimes and lots of games and lots of fun. No television of course
in those days so yeah that’s probably the best memory I’ve got from
being young.... How young were you then? When you did-... Oh from-...
when you did change?... I would think that was from being- from as
early as I can remember being through- going through to being about
twelve. Something like that.... So your life changed soon after you’ve
met me?... Yeah, yeah, yeah.... Yeah.... But erm a- as- as people grew
older they didn’t want to-... families got bigger as well. They
did-... Yeah.... th- they didn’t get together the same.... Up to that
age I erm- I think my Christmases were very similar in that people
came to us for a Christmas lunch. But because the erm, accomodation
that we had at the time was a bit cramped all the children went into
the back room and the adults were in the main dining room cos that’s
when we lived at the laundry. We had a chinese laundry in those
days.... Really?... And the- the front room was shop.... Yeah.... It
was where we did the ironing, stored the laundry that had been
packaged.... Mm.... And the middle room was the living room where we
did everything .... And the back room was the stove room.... There was
a coal fired stove with flat irons against it. But there was a big
table in there as well. So that’s where the kids sat to have their
Christmas dinner. But it was still good fun and happy times.... How
many of you?... In total people- oh- well there was-... Kids.... three
six erm I- I can’t think of it. Two sisters at the time and , myself.
wasn’t with us then.... Oh ok.... was an after thought.... yeah... I
think my mum thought she was going to get a new washing machine for
Christmas you know. She got instead.... Mm.... Erm then there’d be my
three cousins , . You’ve met haven’t you?... Yeah.... From .... Yeah.
.... And .... Mm.... And erm-... and there’d be my grandad. Auntie ,
mum, dad, uncle and auntie they were parents. Uncle and auntie they
were Pamela’s parents. Auntie used to come on her own because grandad
didn’t like uncle -... and uncle didn’t like Grandad . So he- had the-
he had Christmas dinner with his mother.... Aw.... So there was a lot
of us.... Mm.... And erm the odd friend. People like that used to pop
in throughout the day. Erm- but one of the most memorable things as a
kid happened when I was at the laundry. Erm when me grandmother was
alive she used to make beetroot wine.... Ok.... And you had to wait
for it to mature-... before you drank it. But I was being a little bit
eager and I opened one before it was ready and it was like champagne
and this red fizz went a- all over-... Ah- oh no.... freshly laudered
sheets, shirts, pillow cases.... Ha.... A whole days washing was
absolutely ruined. And I think I went to me bedroom, locked it, and I
was there for two day .... I was scared stiff of me grandad.... Hm....
He really did rule the roost.... Really?... Yeah. Fearsome character
but erm extremely kind as well -... and hard working.... Yeah.... His
day used to start at about six o clock in the morning and go on till
three o’clock the following morning.... Wow.... That was Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday. Thursday, Friday, Saturday his day started at nine
and finished about five.... Yeah.... But the laundry was all done by
then and it was just a question of taking in new stuff and delivering
your- or doleing out the laundered stuff to the erm- the regular
customers cos they nearly all were regulars in those days.... Yeah....
They all had their own laundry mark which was written on the back of
their laundry in small chinese writing... Mm.... Mm.... We didn’t know
the names we just knew the mark... Mm.... Yeah but that was all before
I knew you wasn’t it Arnold the erm-... That’s right yeah.... the
laundry.... Yeah.... You hardly ever went did you to the laundry?...
No I never went to the laundry no. We- we had erm- when I was nine
year old we- we moved into a shop. We used to have a shop in . My
mother’s ran the shop. It was erm-... Mm.... ladies and children’s
wear shop.... Oh ok.... We had a few different sidelines as well. And
my mother used to work six days a week in that.... Yeah.... Me dad was
an engineer so he went out to work where he used to help on a
Saturday.... **inc**... Yes love.... And erm when we were there for
six years altogether and erm one of the things I think I’ve mentioned
this to Barney before that always sticks in my mind that was on- on a
Saturday because my mother was still working in the shop-... Yeah....
I used to go to the local chip shop for lunch and I used to get three
lots of fish and chips for half a crown in total. Now half a crown was
twelve and a half pence. So that just shows how prices have
changed.... Yeah.... But erm one of the best things about living there
was the fact that we had a double cellar and in the cellar we used to
have a- a shooting range.... Wow.... With an air rifle.... Erm and my
dad would set up so you could- you could- you could put targets- three
targets in at one end-... Yeah.... and th- and then shoot down this
little-... walled area and erm-... we also used to do photography as
well in the cellar. We used to d- do our own developing and printing
and erm cos we had running water in this cellar. We had a sink in the
corner so- so erm yeah good times yeah. But it-... Yeah we used to do
some of that didn’t we at-... We did that in erm-... in my bedroom....
in- in the attic didn’t we.... Yeah in the attic but there was no
running water there.... No.... Mm.... I don’t know how we coped
really.... Yeah.... We did everything in my bedroom.... Right....
There was a snooker table.... Really?... Yeah and we did the
photography on top of the snooker table.... That’s right.... And when
we weren’t doing the photography we were playing snooker. And somehow
we managed to fit my bed at the other end.... Yeah. It was a big s- a
big attic.... Yeah.... That was a big attic bedroom. And it wasn’t a
small snooker table it was a three quarter size snooker table....
Really?... Yeah.... Yeah.... It was too big for a normal house and I
gave it to erm a youth club-... Mm.... in and erm unfortunately it
closed down soon afterwards didn’t it.... Oh no .... Mm mm.... And I
don’t know what happened to that table.... Mm.... Erm todays prices it
was probably worth about five, six hundred pounds.... Mm.... Wow....
But nobody wanted it cos nobody had room for it. Sign of the times....
taken my glasses away. I know it’s big print.... Are they yours?...
Mm? It’s alright.... Shall-... I can read just fine.... shall we move
on to another-... Yeah.... question?... Would you like some water?
I’ll just get some.... Do you want me to- I can get you some if you
like.... Will you? **inc**... Yeah.... We’ll carry on talking....
Please.... Where are the glasses?... Ah. Ask she’ll know.... Oh ok....
So-... Were there a lot of kids to play with when you were growing
up?... There was when I- when I lived in before we moved to the shop.
Erm there were quite a few kids in the street and they-... Mm.... erm
all similar aged. Erm and because it was a cul-de-sac it had a sort of
a- a- it opened out and there was a- a- a good play area for kids but
we had all the fields at the back as well.... And erm yeah there were
quite of- quite a number of erm both bl- boys and girls to play
with.... Yeah yeah.... Erm I was saying the age difference probably
was three or four years older than me to three or four years younger
than me. So lots of kids.... Yeah I was the same. We had lots of kids
when I was at junior school because in those days most kids went to
school near where they lived.... Yeah yeah.... Nobody went to school
by car.... No.... I don’t know how we managed. Thank you.... Thank
you.... You get a waitress service as well.... You got some- can I
have one of those mats?... Oh yeah.... Thank you.... Can I just say
when we went to junior school all the kids lived near the school....
Yeah.... Nobody ever went to school in a car.... Not even the
teachers.... Really?... They didn’t have cars did they. Oh I think
maybe the headmaster did.... Maybe I think b- by the time we went to
grammar school they probably did-... Yeah. Headmaster had one.... but
I don’t remember any of the- any of the teachers at junior school
having-... No... cars at all. But at grammar school they used to park
just behind- well- well I went to school. There’s- I did three years
at school erm before I moved to where Barney was.... Oh ok.... Erm
travelling from the shop in was about four miles to school from there
and there were probably three or four teachers had cars in those
days.... Mm.... And one of the- one of the erm- the thing that
everybody envied was my cousin. He was in the sixth form when I
started.... And he had a motorbike and he used to park this motorbike
in the- in the little- there was a little extension to the playground
where the teachers-... parked their cars. And he used to erm leave his
bike there and I was the envy of the other kids when I got a lift home
with him.... Yeah.... Yeah. We had a g-... Cause there were no crash
helmets in those- you just got on the back and went didn’t you....
Yeah there were always a couple of guys at school had motorbikes and
they were always the ones that had girlfriends and erm-... Yeah....
They’d imaged themselves on James Dean and erm-... Mm.... Tony
Curtis-... Mm.... who you might’ve heard of.... Yeah.... And they were
always the rebels who left school with no O-levels and erm-...
**inc**... Yeah.... but lots of girlfriends.... yeah.... Lots of
reputation behind them-... Mm.... which they c- couldn’t put on theirs
CVs .... But at junior school lots of kids to play with. Erm-...
Mm.... Out- out playing everyday. Erm I don’t think our parents had
any fears about us going out and s- being out.... No no.... Erm-...
When we lived at the shop in there was just down the lane was a park
with swings and- and roundabouts and-... Yeah.... sliding and erm we
used to spend all day there sometimes you know you- you didn’t w- h-
worry about your kids being out.... No.... Never heard of paedophiles
and erm-... Well it was a word that hadn’t been invented I don’t
think.... Erm I don’t think it had no and-... Erm we had one in Eccles
who I now realise was a paedophile.... Yeah.... Everyone knew him so
you just avoided him.... He was called .... Yeah.... and he wore a big
fedora-... Yeah.... hat.... Keep it anonymous.... Yeah.... Yeah I’ll
not tell you his surname.... His surname.... And he wore a big long
mac and great big boots. He was straight off a Lowry. Erm and he had a
most horrible face and sometimes you could walk down towards -...
Mm.... and you’d see him on the aquaduct. You could- his image was
there. So y- you now had to decide did you wait for your mate before
you went over the bridge to go to church-... or did you just wait ‘til
he was looking the other way and run like hell.... Well that’s how we
coped with paedophilia in those days. Just avoiding... I know.... I
never got that close to him. I don’t re-... Oh .... I don’t remember
what he looked like .... Oh I- I go-... I think he was just a legend
when I went to-... when I got to .... I got too close to his brother
one day erm- there was a guy who was in our year at grammar school .
Do you remember ?... Yeah yeah.... Oh he lived near and he had a mad
brother. And if people used to hang about outside their house he’d
open the window and he used to have a jerry under the bed.... A wee
pot or whatever . And he used to empty it.... oh no.... So- over
whoever was standing outside his house.... .... Aye that was ....
Mm.... But we were lucky where we lived because there were lots of
fields nearby.... Yeah.... Erm didn’t exist and you were soon going
toward... mm... and round there there were lots and lots of fields
where you could just enjoy yourself and-... Yeah.... go home with jam
jars full of newts and tadpoles and erm-... Tha- that’s right and
there was-... and there was no traffic on the roads. There was-...
No.... there were very few cars so you- you- there was danger of
crossing main roads and- mm-... No you could go on your bike
anywhere.... Yeah.... I mean regular bike trips were-... Mm.... places
like Lymm, Pickmere.... Mm.... And if you were really fit Chester or
Southport.... Southport even.... Really?... Mm.... Mind you I did
Chester once and I was so tired when I got there.... not surprised....
Had my- had my sandwiches bottle of pop., and I said ‘we’d better get
off’ .... ‘If I stay much longer I’ll fall asleep and I’ll never get
home’. Ah- it seems to take forever in a car now.... It does-...
Mm.... It takes- it seems to take longer in a car than it used to on
the bike.... It’s- so does Southport.... I’m sure. Used to- we always
used to reckon Southport was thirty miles but-... I’m sure it’s- it-
it’s the road system. Must be the road system these days it’s- it’s
nearer forty-... Mm.... you know.... Yeah.... I noticed one of the
questions here says did you ever get hurlt- hurt whilst playing when
you were a kid? I remember breaking my arm once.... Oh.... We used to
have- in our garden we used to have a- a six foot wall at the back.
Drop down. And we used to swing on a s- on a washing line-... out and
drop into the garden.... Yeah.... And my f- ankle got tangled up in
the rope.... Oh no.... So I swung out and my ankle stayed where it
was-... Oh.... Ah.... and I went down and I broke my arm. That’s erm-
I’ve only had three breaks in my life and that was the first one.
**inc**... I’ve- I’ve never had a break.... Haven’t you?... No....
Yeah.... Yeah.... Mind you I’ve never played rugby and you have.... My
only- I’ve only had one break playing rugby and that was this erm
metatarsal but erm I broke my ankle playing soccer-... Oh.... when I
was about eighteen, seventeen perhaps. Mm.... Yeah the only visit I
had to erm casualty as we used to call it not accident and emergency
was when I fell off a swing. Must’ve been about nine, ten and there
was a little bit of competition going on to see who could do the most
daring things on the swing.... Like jump off while it was still in the
air and not using your hands and just s- sticking with it and I got to
the back swing and just fell off chin first.... oh no.... Mm.... Yes
it was that scar.... Still got a scar?... Oh yeah.... Yeah....
Yeah.... So I went home. Mum took me to casualty and the nurse s- said
‘Oh well that’s one way to lose a bit of fat isn’t it’... Mm mm....
then she just got her scissors out and cut the excess fat off and
stitched it up.... **inc**... Done and dusted. No local. Erm so that
was swinging. Erm- Yeah, the only other time in casualty, was erm
three years ago when I fell. Tripped over -... Oh aye you did yeah....
the dog.... Oh.... I nearly lost me thumb and I had to have-...
Wow.... they couldn’t count the stitches. Well I couldn’t. I just got
fed up of trying to keep count. It was all round here as far as
there.... Oh yeah.... I was lucky that was around and erm she wrapped
a towel around it. Put it in the air.... Mm.... And she drove me to
hospital. And it was the first time she’d driven that car.... ‘I’ve
never driven it before’. But you’ll soon learn.... How are we doing
for time ?... Erm twenty one minutes.... Twenty- oh-... Gone.... ne-
ne-... **inc**... Shall we mo- shall we move on?... nearly- nearly
half term. Yes lets move on.... It’s all about school and we’ve t-...
Oh we done-... we’ve touched on school.... touch- touched on school
and erm- what have we got there scholarsh-?... Right.... Holdays?...
No where did you go to school it says.... Where did you go to school.
Oh here right.... That one.... That one... Mm hmm.... Mm hmm.... Well
I started at school.... for short. Erm was a victorian philanthropist
who did things like building hospitals and schools.... Oh ok.... And
he built one in for the erm Church of England children who lived in .
There was already a Church of England school there attached to the
church-... Mm.... called - but it was the other side of .... Oh ok....
And very few lived on that side .... Most of the kids lived on the
side. And that’s probably one reason why he sited it where he did in
erm- in .... And I should think the bridge was probably closed a lot
more in those days as well than it is- it is today-... Oh it’s very
busy traffic yeah.... cause there was a lot of traffic up and down-...
Yeah.... the ship canal-... I bet it was opened and closed every
hour.... to the docks.... Mm.... So-... Yeah.... There was a- always
queues.... Yeah so-... I remember queues when I first started driving
every time I tried to cross bridge.... Really?... Yeah.... Went there
from five ‘til- five years ‘til I was ten and then ‘til I was
seventeen. Seven years there.... Mm. I started at school in erm or on
the border I think which was just a- a standard state school. Quite
big classes in those days about- I think I remember there were forty
eight kids in the class.... Wow.... Erm and there were- it was quite a
big school because there were four streams A, B, C, and D in the
secondary school and we erm-... tended t- to have just one teacher for
all the lessons.... Yeah.... Erm and I remember that starting in the
second year at junior school and the- the teacher came in- our form
teacher and started writing on the board in real writing. And none of
us had learnt real writing before that time-... Really?... so he
realised he had to stop and teach us how to do real writing-... before
he could teach us anything else.... Gosh.... So that’s- that’s the-
the time we learnt it. And then in the fourth year we all took our
eleven plus t- to g- see if we could go to grammar schools.... Mm....
And out of the school- out of the year there were twelve people passed
their eleven plus.... Wow.... And I was one of them and I went to
grammar school.... And erm touching on one of these questions here.
First day at- at school at school. There was an initiation ceremony
and between two sets of steps and the school there was a like erm a-
a- the- the bank went down and then there was like a- a gully which
was about three foot wide and three foot deep. Erm and probably ten
yards wide at the very most and all the first year kids were thrown
into that-... Oh no... on the first day.... So there were probably
fifty or sixty kids crammed into this thing.... And if you ever-... if
you tried to get out you got thrown back in-... bodily.... Was it
that-... And that was called a monkey run.... Was that an all boys
school-... No no no no-... or was it mixed?... that was- it was mixed
but it was segregated playgrounds of course.... Yeah yeah we had
that.... Yeah it was mixed yeah.... Yeah.... Yeah. That erm- so that
was-... Yeah w- w- we had it like that.... the monkey run. Everybody
in brand new school uniforms-... Yeah.... got thrown in the dirt you
know. The first day.... Well I suppose ours was a cleansing our i-
initiation ceremony. You had your head put in the toilet and the
toilet flushed.... flushed... Mm.... I think a lot of headmasters in
those days tried to run their schools along public school lines....
Mm.... And erm they must have knew- known these intiation ceremonies
were going on-... Yeah.... Oh yeah yeah.... and it were just ‘part of
school life old chap’.... Mm.... You know .... Yeah.... Erm cos I
presume you had to wear a school cap did you?... We had to wear a
school cap at all times on the way to school-... Yeah.... on the way
home from school, lunchtimes if you went out. Although you weren’t
generally allowed out of school unless you were going home for
lunch.... Yeah then you had to have written permission for that didn’t
you.... Yeah yeah. Well I- I once got erm into trouble for going out
of school at lunchtime. We used- we used- we used-... Well I did. It
was when I went out with you to the local café .... Yeah....
**inc**... But this was when I was at -... Had a quick pepsi and a
woodbine .... We got- we got caned. Two of us went out to buy a bottle
of sauce to have with our school dinner.... And we were on second
sitting and we got caught. Called before the headmaster and we got
caned for erm going out of school at lunchtime.... Oh no.... what kind
of sauce was it?... OK .... OK .... .... Or Daddies I’m not sure. One
or the other.... Yeah yeah .... Did you have to wear short
trousers?... No we- we- we weren’t obliged to wear short trousers. I
wore long trousers in the first year.... Oh. We were erm-... But no we
could wear long trousers.... third year before we could wear long
trousers.... Mm.... In fact-... When I joined school in the forth year
there were still some of the lads-... Yeah.... wearing short
trousers-... really?... in the forth year and that would’ve been what
age fifteen, sixteen?... Fifteen, sixteen.... Yeah.... Yeah well if
the parents still thought ‘those shorts still fit’-... Yeah .... I’m
not buying you long trousers just bec-... Waste of money.... Yeah
waste of money.... Mm.... Yes it was erm- the girls wore gym slips in
the winter and dresses in the summer.... Mm.... Which they don’t seem
to do now do they.... No.... No.... That’s right they- that was erm-
that was the same at . The girls had a uniform dress for the
summer-... Yeah yeah.... for the summer term. And the other two terms
they had to wear gym slips up to a certain age and then it was skirts
and blouses wasn’t it after a certain age and ties-... Oh yes after y-
about forth year. Yeah.... Yeah. White blouses.... Yeah I’ve- I’ve got
one of those old school photographs that’s about a yard long-... or
two yards long. And you can see all the different uniform styles-...
Yeah.... according to their ages on that.... Show that to actually-...
Yeah.... It’s quite interesting-... Mm.... cause I- I think we
both-... Did you have them taken in your school?... Yeah.... Yeah
**inc** the long ones.... Yeah. I think we’re both on that one aren’t
we?... I think we are yeah.... Is that the fifty nine one- fifty eight
one?... Fifty eight, fifty nine something like that yeah.... Fifty
eight yeah. Yeah.... Yeah. You’re on the back row.... I was showing
the other night.... Were you? .... Yeah came across it. Yeah....
Mm.... Yes so we both remember our first days at school then....
Yeah.... I- I- my initiation was easy because I knew some of the lads
in the second year and erm they did me a favour and erm made sure I
didn’t get too much of a ducking in the toilets .... Yeah.... They
wanted me to play football in their team as well.... I spent my
life-... I’ve-... school life being favoured and because I had a
certain amount of what most people thought was a little bit of talent
at football.... Mm.... And erm it was misguided. This lad, cricket I
was selected for the school cricket team. And I was still in shorts
and it was ridiculous going out to play cricket in shorts.... So my
mum had to take me to the co-op in Eccles to buy me some white long
trousers to play cricket.... And I never got a bat or a bowl. I
must’ve been a pretty good fielder .... Mm. We used to erm- well we
both played for the same under fifteens-... Oh yeah yeah.... football
team. was captain who we still see occassionally.... Mm.... Mm.... And
erm Barney was vice captain and I’d just joined the school in the
fourth year. And played in one or two games classes and they picked me
to play on the under fifteens team.... Right.... So we’ve got a
photograph of that somewhere.... We have. Yeah.... Was the team
good?... We played in- and then we played e- for the school team
didn’t we the following year.... Yeah yeah.... And the erm- the full
team. But we were both quite keen on erm athletics and- and sports as
well.... Yeah.... I never played cricket very much but erm-... I used
to join in all the erm different sports day activities.... Yeah I was
erm junior athletics champion. Me and , -... That were before erm-...
Before you joined wasn’t it.... oh yeah cos you were a year- no it’s
probably the year I joined. But you were in- you were a year younger
than me.... Yeah.... So you were still in junior school weren’t
you.... Well I w- I was-... When-... in the second year.... Oh is- it
was when you were in second year was it.... Yeah yeah.... Oh.... Yeah
I think to get-... Cause I-... junior you had to be under thirteen....
Did you yeah.... Yeah.... Cause I came second to in the erm middle
school.... Mm.... Erm Rex Ludorum they used to call it.... Yeah....
King of the games.... Mm .... I came- I came second and came third.
Much to his annoyance.... .... He’d been bragging the year before-...
that he was gonna win it.... Oh .... what was the leading girl called?
If the leading man was Rex or Victor- Victor Ludorum wasn’t it- the
erm the men or the-... Was it Victor a-... Victor vic-... at . It was
Rex at .... Was it? Erm it was Victor at .... Victor at . Victor
Ludorum.... So-... I don’t know what the girl got called.... No I only
did Latin for one year.... Don’t know. Didn’t- I didn’t know any girls
called Victor.... Victoria.... Victorlia- Victoria Ludarum- Ludorum...
Oh blimey. No no-... I don’t know what’s the female-... that would-
that would stay-... what’s the female adjec-... that would stay no
Ludorum.... W- Ludorum would be the same.... Th- that would- that
wouldn’t- that wouldn’t be sexed.... You don’t change it like in
French from petit to petite.... No it’s- that- that Ludorum means ‘of
the games’ doesn’t it?... Yeah.... Mm.... So it could’ve been erm-...
Yeah Victoria Ludorum .... Vict- could’ve been Victris or some-
Victrix.... Victrix or something like that I suppose.... Yeah....
Anyway.... .... Hello.... from Mercedes Benz.... Erm could I give him
a ring back if you get his number? Please... How long?... Oh ab-
another half an hour at least.... Mm.... They always say ‘are you
happy with your car?’ and I think yeah .... Yes, music music. We did a
lot music together didn’t we. School choir-... Well yeah we were
in-... at gammar school.... the school choir and then-... School
orchestra.... No I wasn’t in the school orchestra.... Weren’t you?...
No. No I never went in the sc- well what did you play in the
school-... I played guitar but it- it was the cello part.... Oh yeah
it’s right.... Erm.... That was after I’d left I think.... Ah.... It
was when I was in the sixth form.... The teacher just put a few-...
Yeah.... notes down that normally a cellist would play.... Yeah....
And I had to just plonk them out .... No.... But we erm- we played at
the school concert didn’t we.... Played at school- school con-... Our
school dance.... school dance yeah. As a group.... Mm.... At the
hop.... Yeah. Yeah we-... Did we call them dances or did we- we didn’t
call them hops or anything?... No no no no. It was the school dance.
Yeah-... Erm.... at erm- we were the first group ever-... Yeah.... to
play at a school dance.... Oh.... **inc**... That was in nineteen
fifty eight. Christmas dance.... Aye. And what did you-... I can even
remember what songs we played .... What you sang . Go- w- w- what

Mm.... Yeah. Erm-... And we’re still practising.... still can’t play.
But I think we did- did we just do that one year?... Yeah yeah.... Did
they ask us back?... Aw... Well I w- well I left.... You left of
course yeah.... I left that Christmas.... That’s why... Yeah w- yeah I
started work. Yeah.... Yeah w- we went on to bigger- bigger and better
venues after school.... Mm.... I- Eccles town hall was our last
appearance. was the first appearance.... Yeah. And then he went off to
university so we split up then.... Oh right.... Yeah erm-... Mm....
and him and the lead guitarist and the drummer they prefered to buy
cars and motorbikes and things instead of amplification.... Mm....
Erm-... But we didn’t- no- not- no-... but we’d have- we wouldn’t have
been able- w- we had amplification of such.... As such- yeah. Of a
sort.... We had microphones sellotaped-... Yeah.... to the back of our
guitars.... leading into reel to reel tape recorders.... Wow.... So it
was really not loud at all... No... Mm. Oh it w- it was a treat to
have played at a venue where they had a microphone wasn’t it-... Oh
aye they had their own PA system.... because quite a few of them
didn’t.... Really?... So there were no mic- no amplification in some
of them.... No.... The school had a- a microphone didn’t they....
Yeah.... And the erm- certainly Eccles town hall did.... Yeah and
Urmston baths.... Mm. Mm.... Urmston baths is- do you remember when it
was the erm circular one?... Is that when it was the Curzon?...
Opposite the Curzon.... Mm. I- my dad’s told me about it.... Yeah,
well they used to have dances there.... Oh ok.... They used to put
boards over the- the pool... and we played there once at Urmston and
Flixton junior football league’s presentation evening.... Oh ok.... We
sounded good with the echoes and-... Oh yeah yeah the echoes.... the
water and-... Mm.... the roof top. And it was a complete dome at the
top made out of glass and one year I think it was s- let me see was
about six or seven. It’d have been about nineteen eighty. We had in-
tremendous hale stones. Bigger than golf balls.... Wow.... And they
went right through the roof of Urmston baths.... Oh.... And of course
all the glass followed and all the tiles were damaged and-... the
council said it’s erm not economical to repair. So they knocked it
down.... Oh is that why?... Yeah-... Oh I didn’t know that.... and it
was a magnificent building. Th-... I’ve seen a picture of- mm.... they
had diving boards and erm nice café sauna. Did you ever go? Erm-... I
think I probably just went the odd time.... Yeah.... But I used to
when I was younger and we used to go from school. We were taught to
swim from school went to .... Yeah we went to -... And erm-... from
junior school.... Yeah-... But at grammar school there was no swimming
at all was there.... that was- that was quite- and . I- I went to a
few times. I lot of my youth I spent in the scouts and the sea scouts
based at from being about thirteen year old-... Mm.... up to it was
probably about twenty six when I packed it in altogether .... What we
used to do spend a load of time goin away camping and-... Oh yeah....
Yeah. But erm-... Well my grandad wouldn’t allow me to go in the
scouts. He didn’t believe in it.... Really?... Oh.... And grandad’s
word was gospel.... Mm.... He said it’s like Hitler youth.... Mm....
He thought it was an army for kids.... Mm.... But being he wanted to
be very, very English and tow the line. So Sundays we weren’t allowed
to play out. We were not forced but highly encouraged to go to
church.... Yeah.... So eventually I joined the church choir at about
the age of seven or eight. So that meant you soon got promotion cos
there weren’t many boys in the choir. I think there were four of us.
You soon got promotion to alter boy.... Yeah.... And then after
confirmation you had to go to the early morning mass. You took it in
turns at going to eight o’clock or nine o’clock. Then you were singing
at eleven o’clock mattins. You had to go to Sunday school at two
o’clock .... And then six thirty evensong.... Busy day .... So busy
day. So you didn’t have- really have time to play out on a Sunday....
Mm.... Yeah erm.... Well everybody went to Sunday school in those
days-... Yeah.... but it was- it was only once for me. There was no
choir cos it was a little mission church down in .... Ah. Well the-
the- the choir was the undoing of the church in many ways. Because we
got a little bit beyond our station. We started singing very high brow
stuff like-... Mm mm.... Handel’s Messiah and-... Mm.... we had to
have erm choral communion every first Sunday in the month.... And the
congregation got a bit fed up with it.... Oh ok.... Cause it wasn’t
the sort of stuff where you could join in the chorus even .... No no
no.... Yeah .... Yeah.... And the c- congregation dwindled until there
were more people in the choir than in the congregation.... Oh.... And
the erm th- the vicar wasn’t very dynamic and his wife was always a
little bit tipsy.... She used to come in and stagger down the aisle
half way-... half way through the service.... Mm.... Her hair all over
the place .... So they knocked it down. And erm the school still
remains school.... Mm.... You know where I mean? On one side on
the-... No.... .... Oh yeah.... Yeah the little school house there....
Yeah.... Erm that’s up for sale.... Mm.... Well the church was the
other side wasn’t it?... The church has gone.... Yeah... Yeah the
church was the other side of the school.... Yeah.... That’s been
flattened.... Mm.... My sister got married there. Erm I think she was
the last one ever to get married there. Erm-... Who ?... .... ....
Yeah.... Mm.... Yeah so I was an usher at that wedding and I was a
very poor student as well.... Oh .... And I couldn’t possibly have
worn me best suit cos it didn’t look very best at all.... So I went to
C and A and all I could afford was one that was five pounds fifteen
shillings.... It looked really smart and it lasted for the wedding.
And then about a week later I was out in the rain with it and it’s
like just falling apart.... It was. It was glued. It wasn’t
stitched.... Oh no.... So it was an expensive suit really considering
I only wore it twice-... before I had to throw it away.... Yeah....
erm-
