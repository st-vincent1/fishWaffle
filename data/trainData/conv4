suitable cos of me problem with me speech.... Oh okay... They used to
hit me over the head with a ruler to get the words out and it made you
wo-... Yeah.... And then I went to . I don’t know if you’ve ever heard
of... mm... it’s a- I loved it there. There was two ladies that’s all
who taught you. I didn’t like school with having the problem with
speech.... mm... It was- you know- but erm I went and as soon as I- I
was fourteen I left.... Really?... Yeah.... Mm.... I just didn’t like
it.... mm... So did I get into trouble? No I don’t think I did. The
only t- I- yeah I got six of the best once.... Mm.... Why?... Well I
used to write d- I used to go to s- erm the school that and there’s
always a bully-... Mm.... Mm.... and I was riding me bike back to
school and he stopped me and he made me give him a lift on my
crossbar. And when I got to school- oh I got stopped- we got stopped
on the way there by a policeman.... mm... ‘Which school do you go to?’
So I told him and the middle of the afternoon I was in the
headmaster’s office and I got six of the best.... mm... Caned for
doing that. And lookayat the world today.... Mm.... Mm.... Just with
having someone on- on your bike. On your crossbar.... Well I left
school- I think I left school when I was six- I think I was sixteen
when I left s- when I left school, I-... Mm. I- I liked me childhood
days yes because I was l- lucky that our house was only about the- a
couple of hundred yards off a farm.... mm... oh, that’s nice... And I
was always on there and I love animals.... Mm.... Yeah.... And me
favourite animal’s the cow. It’s so laid back and-... Mm.... just like
that the cow you know. So I spent a- a lot of my- my time with animals
on- on the farm you know.... Yeah, that’s nice... I once- yeah I was
still at school and there was a c- c- couple of farms not- short
distance. And the farmer asked me to go to the other farm and erm
excuse me. I was walking it and there’s some ditches where all the
water drains in-... Yeah.... and there was a man on a bike acting
suspicious.... mm... So I- I watched him and then I went on and I
caught a butterfly in me hand.... Oh... He cycled up to me then and
said ‘what have you got in your hand?’ I said ‘a butterfly’ He said
erm, ‘let it go! You don’t know what it’s like t- to be fastened
up’.... mm, mm... So I did and erm I went to the other farm and
walking back I went to have a lookayin this ditch. And I found erm
clothes, prison clothes . It was an escaped prisoner.... So I left
them and I went to the police station in Urmston and they said ‘have a
lookayat will you at this bookayand see if you can find him’. And I
found him and they gave me five shillings.... Really?... yeah... Oh
five shillings oh.... S- so erm I can u- understand the story now with
the butterfly and you know... Yeah.... S- so that was on- one of my
school stories anyway and erm I suppose there’s a lot isn’t there
really. But it wasn’t bad. I enjoyed me school i- in a way....
Yeah.... Mm.... And erm and I’m a great believer your life’s mapped
out... mm... because on the piece of land I live now I lived in
nineteen thirty.... Really?... But this is a modern house now and
there was an old house on there.... mm... And I didn’t know when I
bought this house exactly where I’d lived.... That’s funny.... So I do
believe y- your life in a way your pattern of life is led.... Mm,
mm... You know because I’m going to end up where I started off you
know .... mm... Mm. Have you got any more Fearne then them that you’ve
thought of?... Well there’s one here one at the top. W- where are your
parents from? Now that’s an **inc** question because erm I got an old
photograph at home.... Mm.... Very old photograph.... Mm.... Erm when
me mother was alive-... Yeah.... she lived w- we moved away from up
to- moved up to . She was alive then-... Yeah.... but I didn’t knew me
father at all.... No.... No. So- so I don’t know about that one but
erm I mean me uncles and all that me aunties are you know passed away.
So it’s-... yeah... Yeah, yeah, yeah.... So- so it just that, erm,
w-... Is your mother from L- Lancashire or out of the county?... Erm
sh- sh- she could- she could be. I mean you know.... mm, you don’t
really know.... We don’t really know. You know you’re so young you
sometimes you know.... mm... Do you know what happened in those days?
They would never tell you anything.... Really?... Your parents. They
kept s- **inc** secret.... mm... I erm- when I was five I went to my
Grandma’s funeral in .... Yeah.... And you weren’t allowed to see
anything so I- I was taken for a walk in the village. It was a lovely
village. There was a stream and it was a beautiful village and I was
only five. And all me life I had this picture of this village and
whenever I asked my parents what it was called ‘what do you want to
know for?’ And I must’ve been about seventy and we had a motorhome
then.... And I said to my wife ‘come on. I’m going to find-...
Yeah.... the name of this village’. I knew where one of the ancestors
lived and we went into this erm village and they said ‘oh you’d better
ask at the postoffice he’ll know’. So we went in the postoffice, says
‘I can’t help you. I’ve only been here two weeks’.... Oh... So he
didn’t know any of the villagers. So an- anyway in the end we did find
a person of the surname that we were looking for. So we went round to
this house and as we- and I said to me wife ‘get out and ask this lady
walking down the path if they know a ’. So she got out and this lady
says ‘come on in it’s me mother’.... Really?... mm, oh... Yeah. And
she told me the name of the village. So after about seventy years I
went back and it still looked the same to me.... Really?... But they
had secrets they wouldn’t tell you.... mm... mm... ‘W- what do you
want to know for?’ And erm-... Yeah, yeah, yeah... So I’m half
Lancashire and half Yorkshire.... Mm.... ooh... Mother’s from
Yorkshire. Near . And me dad’s from and he was a joiner. Erm me- m-
mother w- worked in service.... mm... What was called service in those
days. She more or less lived in the house and was responsible for the
house.... yeah... Looking after it. Cleaning it, meals, everything you
know... mm... and in those days it was called service. And she worked
in then.... Mm... Erm not much about school is there at the moment?...
No, no erm... it’s just that I’m looking at this other one here,...
mm... the local evening news stories about thi- important people know
about your- your town.... Well as I said before in I meant to t- I
meant to tell you this but I got two sisters which I never seen....
No.... very long- for a very long time.... mm... I’ve got their
address and I gave it to me brother to-... mm... you know to get in
touch you know with us but I don’t know if he’s done it yet. I don’t
know. Sometimes- I usually go down to see him but he meets me so, cos
it’s a long way.... Right.... Mm.... c- cos he’s moved into a bungalow
now you see. He’s not- he’s never been married you know, he’s-...
Mm.... Well I’m not asking how old you are Fearne but -... No. I’m not
that bothered about my age.... Were you at school in the war or- or
af- or after?... I’ll be- I was born in nineteen forty one so I’ll
be-... Oh you missed it. Well no you were born in the war.... **inc**
born in the war yeah.... mm, mm, mm... So I’ve got an old big
photograph you know erm at home somewhere but erm-... Yeah.... I
remember I used to have this old three wheeled bike. Very old three
wheeled bike-... Mm oh yeah. Yeah.... A very old one you know. In ,
very old. And the people w- w- when we put our house up for sale...
Yeah.... and a nice couple b- bought it. You know nice coloured people
bought it you know... mm, mm... So that’s when we moved for my
mother’s health you know.... Yeah mm.... Mm.... So she couldn’t
travel. She couldn’t go out at all much.... Yeah.... No.... No, so...
Well the war started didn’t it in nineteen thirty nine.... Yeah, yeah
so-... And I was at school then-... Yeah.... Yeah.... which overlooked
the canal.... Oh.... Oh the boats that went along there they were
fabulous you know it’s- you don’t see them now.... No.... They’ve all
gone.... Mm.... Massive big boats with a- a- a tug a- at the front to
pull it. T- t- tug at the back to steady it back you know-... Mm....
and the bridge used to swing... and that was good there th- for a- w-
watching that you know.... Mm.... So I- I was at school when the war
started and erm it was a queer time because all the street signs were
moved. All the lights were taken awa- no lights were allowed to be
on.... Mm.... All the cars had to have a light with a slit in it
only.... It was a- a weird place didn’t it. All the names went didn’t
they.... Mm.... They were taken away and- and where I lived in there
was a barrage balloon site on the corner. And the barrage balloon was-
it was f- f- filled with gas and when the airraid came it used to go
into the air to stop aircraft d- diving down.... Oh, okay.... Because
we lived a short distance from -... Yeah, mm... which was erm industry
in the war.... Mm.... And erm- and when the wind was- if the barrage
balloon went up and it was windy the ba- the barrage balloon used to
sway into our- our back garden you know and erm yeah.... did it?...
You just were frightened to death you know and they erm and leading to
was big oil drums on the side of the road-... Right.... with a **inc**
out.... mm... And the Germans used to follow the ship c- canal from L-
Liverpool-... Mm.... when the- the moonlight was out you can be sure
there’s going to be a raid you know.... Mm.... And you used to f- f-
follow the moon No left channel... up the canal and if the wind was
blowing to Trafford Park they used to light these oil drums so a mass
of smoke went over the park and they couldn’t find it.... Oh....
Oh.... Yeah. So erm- I think I’ve lived in the best time cos radio was
still new. T- television had been thought of but it had been put on
one side because of the war.... yeah... Buses were always on time....
**inc**... Weren’t they Fearne ?... Oh yeah.... If you went out for a
bus-... It’d be there... it was there.... mm... And you can erm- it
was you know. Now what are the most important changes in- in a- in
your town?... don’t know... Mm.... Well it’s changed- we have no
cinemas left.... No. No we haven’t. There’s- that big one in Sale-...
Yeah.... that’s just standing there. I know- I used to go there one
time.... Yeah **inc**... But it’s just standing there doing nothing
you know. Sh- sh- it’s a shame really you know.... They’ve gone
because my youth I used to go to the cinema about twice a week....
Yeah.... And when I got a little bit older, do you remember Urmston
baths?... Not the old one.... Not the old one.... I know the new one.
talks about- cos it used to be the didn’t it?... Yeah.... Yeah....
Well the Urmston baths in the winter. They used to empty the water
out-... Mm.... put a wooden floor over it. And it was sprung like a
proper dance floor and they had dancing every Saturday and
Wednesday.... Really?... And they had a big bands. About a fifteen
piece band that came every week.... Ah.... Mm.... That was fun....
Mm.... And you daren’t drink cos if you’d had a drink a girl wouldn’t
dance with you.... It was very strict in those days.... So yeah U-
Urmston’s v- very busy now. Whereas I can- one- one memory I’ve got in
the school days when the war started was me mother pushing the pram
with my sister in-... Mm .... down to Urmston a blackout c- c-
curtaining you know. Cos we had orders. We hadn’t got to sh- sh- show
any lights at all and-... Yeah.... you had to have your windows
blacked out so nobody could see and that is one of the memories I’ve
got. And then the bombs dropping round you. It was a bit of a hectic
time wasn’t it.... **inc**... **inc** anxious time.... **inc** those-
those days, yeah... You never got a night in bed-... Mm.... Mm....
without you were i- in- in a- a air raid sh- shelter.... Yeah that’s
right they’d shelters didn’t they. Yeah.... No. Ours- ours was in the
house.... Really?... There was an Anderson shelter- you’ve- have you
heard of an Anderson?... I’m not quite sure if I have heard of it....
It’s all cast- and it’s all iron metal.... Right.... With four sides
and a metal top. So if the bomb- house fell on it it wouldn’t- you’d
be safe inside there you know.... Yeah.... Yeah.... We had a wired
mesh all around it like an- animals **inc**.... And that was called-
and that was inside ours. The Anderson shelter.... We had one outside
our house.... Did you?... In our old house.... yeah... It had like
pebbles over it so it looked like it was just part of the ground....
Yeah so it looked like a part of the garden. Yeah.... Oh yeah.... I
never- we couldn’t get into it cos it was all blocked off inside....
Mm.... Oh.... But at least I found **inc**.... Yeah, yeah. Yeah th-
they were scary days weren’t they in a way Fearne ?... Mm it was
yeah.... You know cos you didn’t know what’s going to happen.... I
mean I was only v- I must’ve been very young-... Yeah.... to you know.
It’s erm-... mm... Well as I said I didn’t like school.... Did you
move house at all when you were young? What memories do you have of
this?... I moved house once. I moved from where I live now to another
part of where me p- parents stayed until they p- passed away so-...
Yes.... so they were there a long time.... Mm. Mm.... I- I- I lived
there ‘til I was twenty five. Cos there was a lot going on in Urmston
then.... Mm.... I went- with being stammering I was very shy and
reserved and I thought I’ve got to do summat about this. So I went and
had d- d- d- d- dancing lessons in Urmston.... Really?... Yeah and I
enjoyed it and I’ve got all my medals for dancing .... mm... Yeah and
that was a way of b- bringing me out you know... **inc**... Yeah. Mm.
And then course you were always g- going dancing and m- we had a milk
bar in Urmston.... Did you- did you have a milk bar at all ?... If I
could remember it’s-... They only sold milkshakes.... Really?... Mm.
S- sh- shop’s still there now but they’ve run out of milk. It’s
gone.... Yeah. I tell you what I was thinking of last night. I knew
what I wanted to do when I left school and as soon as I was fourteen I
was out.... Mm.... And I wanted to be a lithographic printer.... Oh
yeah.... I was always interested in printing all- this was nineteen
forty four. There was one year left of the war. But it was ending and
there were soldiers were arriving home then.... mm... So they had to
have their old jobs back.... Right.... You c- I c- could not get a
job... mm... to be a lithographic printer. So- I’m talking a lot
aren’t I.... No you ca- no you carry on you carry on!... So there was
an advert in the newspaper. The evening news.... ‘Boy wanted to learn
lithographic printing’ Manchester. So I was there for eight o’clock
and the job had gone.... Right.... Oh.... Dear me. Anyway so they said
‘but we’ve got a vacancy in the handwritten department’. Now don’t ask
me what that was.... So they- I went along with them upstairs and they
showed me. There was about nine men working there all doing
handwritten posters-... Oh.... which they did in those days.... Mm....
I mean I can r- r- remember Urmston it was just full of posters on the
walls. Most of those were hand done.... mm... mm... All- o- others
were lithographic printed so I started there. And erm to cut a long
story short I did that the rest of my life for fifty years.... But
when I worked there got a pound a week.... A pound.... And I’ve
written this down because I’d forget it wouldn’t I... You came
prepared .... I had to go on the bus to Manchester six days a week.
That cost me fifty four d, old p- pence a week. I had to give me m-
mother ninety p oh no d, of the old money.... Mm.... I used to go to
the pictures twice a week for th- th- thirty d. Thirty pence. Thirty
eight old money and I was left with sixty six p- p- p-... **inc**...
for a week and that was a pound.... Pound.... And I used to live on
it... mm... mmhmm... and I think now. I think that’s now why it’s made
me appreciate-... Yeah.... mm... the value of money.... Mm.... And erm
if I can jump a bit further I then left there and went to work for
another firm who did, you won’t have heard of these will you-...
No.... You’ll have heard of them won’t you?... **inc**... Oh yes,
yeah, yeah.... Yeah, yeah.... **inc**... Yes. Mm.... Oh dear.... Well
the were the biggest circuit in England of cinemas.... Oh, okay....
And some cinemas used to change three times a week. Monday Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday Friday Saturday and a different one on a
Sunday-... Right.... so people went.... Yeah.... And there was about-
I think there was sixty of us worked there. And we used to do abou- I-
I forget the amount but it was in hundreds. The circuit was in
hundreds of cinemas. And we used to do them all by hand every week.
One week’s holiday. A forty eight hour week and that’s where I really
learnt me job there you know my trade.... mm, yeah.... They went
bankrupt.... Oh no.... And I got oth- other jobs you know and then I
always wanted to have me own business and I started my own business in
nineteen sixty six . I found this old property and I started in
business on two weeks holiday pay that I’d got from the firm....
Yeah.... Fifteen- thirty pound it was for two weeks.... Uh huh....
**inc**... Out of that I had to pay sixteen pound to rent the shop. It
was a big gamble wasn’t it.... Mm.... Yeah.... But I was lucky that I
got the c- custom you know.... Yeah.... Struggled and erm- but people
were good in those days c- anyway I- I managed to get- make friends
with a chappy who worked for I think it was Esso petroleum. And he- he
was responsible for ad- advertising and he used to bring me the
advertising to do you know big wooden signs.... Yeah... And so I
hadn’t erm money to buy the wood even to do them on. But there was a
wonderful sh- shop in where th- you know they used to sell wood....
Mm.... And he said to me ‘Edmund you take it. When you get paid you
pay me’ and I thought that was lovely that.... Yeah.... You know. And
I worked on my own for t- twenty five years and enjoyed it. Erm and I
lookayback on life it’s- it’s had its bad times I’ve married twice....
Yeah.... First time okay, you can’t have it perfect can you.... Mm....
And then me wife- I went out with me wife once when I was about
eighteen and the problem was she was a friend of the fam- or their-
her parents were a friend of my parents and whenever she came round I
went out you know.... mm... Mm.... So anyway we went out with each
other once. We didn’t like each other... dear me.... We went off an
married somebody else and fifteen years later I got divorced. D-
didn’t know where was. Hadn’t the slightest where she was. Until a
friend of mine who was an insurance agent he said ‘I’ve just knocked
at a house in Stretford and this - came to the door.’ I said ‘did
she?’ He said ‘yeah’ he said erm ‘she’s got divorced and she’s living
in and she’s a bit of alright yeah Edmund ’ Left channel resumes... oh
dear... So Edmund wrote to her mother... And that’s how that started
all over again.... Really? Oh.... So you can see why I believe your
life’s mapped out.... Yeah.... Cos how did I meet her again in when I
was here?... Yeah.... You know.... And both divorced and things....
Yeah this is it you know. And that- that was fantastic that. I’ve got
a boy off me first marriage and off the second I’ve got t- two girls
you know.... **inc**... One’s okay One’s very okay, one’s lovely....
mm... And the other one sh- she was even odd with her mother you
know.... Mm.... I haven’t heard off her for a year now.... Really?...
I mean her mum died th- th- th- what three year ago now wouldn’t it
be. Yeah. And erm sh- she’s strange.... Mm.... Course there’s always
strange ones about.... mm... P- people say I’m strange. No left
channel... Well when I left school-... Yeah.... when I left school I
would **inc** I did erm I work in -... Yeah.... in a factory but erm I
was a- I was a cleaner there.... Mm.... Cleaner. You know full time
cleaner.... Oh yeah, yeah.... I’ve not just do- I’ve always done
cleaning.... Who do you work for? I might know them.... Erm well it’s
called - . It’s not- they’re not there an-... No, no.... But the
building’s still there.... Yeah. No I don’t remember them.... Erm the-
it- quite a few got made redundant.... Mm.... I couldn’t tell you how
many years that was.... Yeah.... But I was made redundant.... Yeah....
And then I worked in the erm- in the canteen you know. I’ve done
canteen work.... mm... I’ve done looking after children-... Yeah....
And erm as you know I look after dogs and all this kind of thing....
Yeah of course. Yeah yeah. Mm.... You know erm hal- in the fact the

looked after.... That’s the most important thing in life isn’t it
trust.... Yeah.... Trust t- trust you know.... You know. If they trust
you. I’ve got a lady who does my house work and I come out many a day
and she lets herself in and I’ve got a lot of f- faith in and trust in
her and it’s nice to have-... Yeah.... Yeah yeah.... cos that’s
important part of life is trust.... Yeah yeah.... You know....
Yeah.... Isn’t it? I you don’t mind if I chatter?... No you carry
on... . It’s what he’s good at... He is isn’t he carry on.... In
ninetee- with having me own business-... Mm.... in nineteen seventy
four I was invited to join the Rotary Club . Have you heard of
Rotary?... No.... No. You’ll- you might’ve heard of Rotary.... I
might’ve heard of it. Long time ago **inc**.... They used to come
round the streets at C- Christmas time with a Christmas float. Yours
in -... Yeah they used to do it- they used-... and Lymm- Lymm- Lymm R-
Rotary Club came round.... Yeah.... And it- it was-... it was started
in America originally.... Mm.... And it’s for business men you know
who’ve reached the top of the ladder.... Yeah.... Well I couldn’t go
any higher cos I worked myself.... You see. So-... I was invited to
join you know.... Oh.... And that was good. And that gave me a lot of
confidence-... Mm.... because they have to stand up and s- give a talk
once a year.... Right.... And I was still very bad stammering. And erm
when it was my t- turn the first time they said ‘Edmund you don’t have
to do it if you don’t want’.... Yeah.... I said I’m going to make them
have it you know. But I did it okay because they’re all on your
side.... Yeah.... That’s the best part of it.... mmhmm... So I w- I
was in t- twenty one years in Rotary. I was ch- chairman of the
community section which looked after the area you know and I loved-...
I like local charity work-... Mm. Yeah. Yeah.... and looking after the
area where I know. And whenever it was my turn to speak th- the
president would announce it the week before that next weeks speaker is
Edmund Jacobs -... and we’re extending the lunch half an hour... Oh
dear.... But all that helped you.... Yeah. Yeah.... Yeah.... And do
you know what I ended up there doing? I was speaker’s secretary....
Really?... Oh .... And yeah. Now that was a good p- part of my
life.... Mm.... Mm.... An- and the wife was in- i- in the ladies
section. I was invited every year to be president but because you had
to visit other clubs I’ve turned it down. But my wife acc- c- cepted
the ladies side of it.... Mm.... oh right... so I used to go out for
free meals with her then.... .... oh dear.... So tha- that was it.
Yeah but in those days Rotary was nearly consisted of-... doctors,
surgeons, solicitors. All local people. All the shops in Urmston were
owned b- by the actual owner. They were privately owned.... Oh.... And
they were all members of the Rotary Club. But there’s none left
now.... No no.... You’ve got the dentist. You’ve got them all sorts
of- all walks of life as a member.... yeah... Yeah.... And erm but
it’s gone now. You can’t walk into any shop without its being a big c-
concern.... Yeah. Mm.... I mean there’s not a- a lot of these shops
like left... yeah... where you can s- s- see the owner.... Mm....

lose the personal touch’.... Yeah.... And you’re always there to-...

husband you know. And when I go out at all in the evening which is
not- I don’t like to go out now. It’s not safe for-... Yeah.... older
people to go out and that’s one of the sad things of life which I’ll
go back to in a minute that. It’s reminded me of something. Erm I’ve
got to let this lady know I’m going out and w- when I’ll be back....

It’s to keep an eye on me cos she knows if- if I don’t get up in the
morning something’s happened don’t they.... Mm.... You know what they
used to like Fearne ?... What?... Christmas time. Go into Manchester
looking at arcade.... Oh aye.... When it was Christmas it- had long
windows down the side of an arcade.... Mm.... The other side of the
arcade was and erm every window was decorated at Christmas with
animation and animals and moving and there was a real spirit of
Christmas.... Mm.... And people used to go down especially just to
look in the windows when it was closed.... Really.... Mm.... Now I
came to Urmston on Sunday and I drove th- th- through Urmston- excuse
me and nearly every window was shuttered.... Mm.... Metal shutters.
Well in my youth you could walk and look in all the shops.... Yeah....
Yeah.... Enjoy yourself. Nowhere was open... mm... but today it’s all
‘keep out’ shutters-... Keep it. Yeah. Keep out, yeah... you know. We
don’t want you and all like that and-... Mm.... No, yeah, yeah.... And
I saw s- something the other day that disgusted me really.... House

Well what do they get out of it?... Yeah.... This is it-... W- w- what
do you get out of damaging anything?... Mm. It’s the same you know a
car’s been stolen. They burn it don’t they.... Yeah.... Many times in
-... Mmhmm... they’re forced to put these new railings up at that big
school.... Mmhmm... Many time- I- and we used to go in there and we
used to look after the dogs. And they used to take the dogs in
there.... yeah... I kept them on the lead cos they weren’t my dogs....
mm... yeah... And erm I used to take you know a doggy bag with me....
Mm.... Mm.... Anyway you always see- every now and again you see cars
been burned.... Oh yeah, yeah.... And I f- I feel sorry for the
person.... The person yeah.... You know. Find out one morning the
car’s not there.... Yeah. You can’t- I can’t understand-... I- I can’t
understand why they can’t- why they do this kind of thing.... Did you
want to ask us any questions? Are w- are w- are we running out of
time?... Erm you’ve got t- ten minutes.... Ten minutes!... **inc** my
word.... My g- my-... Can I just say? Erm my wife and I we- a lot of
people don’t like caravans.... Anyway-... I had one and I used to hold
people up on the road. You know.... Erm... we did about th- th- thirty
years you know. But when I- I- I retired my s- **inc** we’ll go up
into a motorhome which was as fast as a car could go.... Yeah.... And
I’ve been all over England, Scotland and Wales and our hobby when I r-
retired was adopting the old guide dogs.... Really?... Oh yeah I
**inc**.... Oh I loved doing that and I’ve got five dogs’ ashes in the
back garden.... Oh.... And I’m an emotional person and the first dog
we adopted w- was- the owner was blind and deaf. Yeah blind and deaf.
So he had to be with a g- guide dog but he couldn’t hear as well....
God that must be difficult.... So that was difficult.... Mm.... So the
pers- so w- got her you know y- y- you’re interviewed at home to see
if you’re suitable.... Mm.... And w- when you get the dog they come
back in a fortnight to make sure that you’re- the dogs are settled....
mm, mm... Yeah.... And we- oh we went to this dog called Honey. And
the day before we got a phone call from the guide dogs. He says ‘I
hope you don’t mind he wants to meet you’. I said ‘no I don’t mind’
you know. And erm- so we went down and we met him. M- m- my wife sat
beside him and questions were asked and if it meant just a yes or a- a
no answer-... Mm.... my wife had to either t- t- t- tap his hand for
yes. I forget which way round or-... Mm.... rub it for no you know....
Oh okay... And anyway the- he had a- like a- a machine tha- a braille
machine.... Yeah.... And the guide dog people used to t- t- type the
message in and he picked it up.... Right.... So that- but he must’ve
gone deaf later in life cos he could still talk.... Yeah.... So he
could talk to us, anyhow, after half an hour he’d- he’d handed over
the- the- the lead to my wife. He’d handed over the dog’s tablets. He
had his other dog there-... Mm.... but he was handing over his eyes
and his ears.... Aw.... And after half an hour they said to me ‘Mr
Jacobs will you t- t- take the dog’s lead and go’. Well I got outside
there and I thought I’ve taken his eyes and ears away and I cried my
eyes out. and they had to take me for a cup of tea you know.... Aw
.... It’s- it’s a traumatic situation-... Yep... mm... taking away-...
Yeah. I’ve- I’ve done a lot of erm- I do a lot of charity work for-...
Yeah.... for animals you know.... Oh okay Yeah.... And I- you know you
had coppers I’d save them in a carrier bag.... Mm yeah.... Sainsbury’s
carrier bag and I take them down to erm Sale.... Yeah.... Mm.... the,
you know, for sick animals. That’s what I did because I love animals
you know. I don’t like to see people to be cruel you know.... Oh no
no.... No.... Well I seen a greyhound near- in Partington-... Mm.... I
don’t know who it belongs to but it had a- like a- one of these white
collars you know.... Oh yeah. Yeah.... I don’t know if it had escaped
from a greyhound thing or what.... Mm somebody owned it yeah.... Or-
it came up to me friendly.... Mm.... I was watching these- these lads
you know. They’re always drinking frigging beer. Wha- you know....
Yeah oh I know. Yeah mm.... I didn- I saw this- this chap ‘go away, go
a- away’.... Yeah.... And I thought leave him alone. Poor thing’s not
doing any harm.... Yeah of course he’s not hurting anyone.... Yeah....
And I took some biscuits out with me last night.... Mm.... and he
wasn’t there.... Wasn’t there.... No so I don’t know who- who owns it.
But it’s a- it’s a shame you know.... Mm.... Well, when- when we had
ordinary dogs you know pet dogs before we started to adopt-... Mm....
Oh that’s right. We got to the end of the- I- with the guide dogs....
I was saying I don’t think I can have another because of walking them.
So the vet came out with the dogs. He says ‘this dogs are l- these
dogs are lovely to walk’. T- twenty minutes a day and they spent the
rest of the time by the fire. And that was a greyhound.... Yeah....
Greyhound yeah.... Yeah.... Yeah.... So erm anyway I- I never got
round to it because me doggy died and then me wife died.... Yeah....
And on your own you can’t look after a dog.... Yeah.... But just going
back to life. Fearne and myself go to church.... Yeah.... Now whether
that’s made us any better people I don’t know.... Well it does with me
because I mean I do believe. You know.... Yeah.... I’m- I am a
Christian and I do believe.... Yeah mm.... And I do a lot for church
in .... Yeah.... mm... And I help out with the Sunday School as well
you see-... Yeah.... Mm.... with the children. The lady what’s been
doing it for a- a- well her name’s .... Mm.... She’d been doing it for
a long time. She does all the work you know and everything....
Yeah.... Yeah.... And I just go in with her to help her you know....
mm... So-... Well-... that’s what I’m going to do as well.... I
enjoyed ch- church. Really enjoyed it. Been all me life cos I was
first introduced when I was five.... Really?... With going to a church
school.... Mm.... And then a church school. And then I was in the best
youth club of all which was a church and then I moved away from the
church w- when I got married first time. Never went back. And I’ve
been a very active member involved in doing everything.... Yeah....
And enjoyed it. Now I won’t mention any names or where I’m going but
this vicar doesn’t get the best out of me.... Oh really.... Mm....
Yeah, and it’s sad that.... Yeah.... And he knows it. He’s a nice
chap. Great with my wife when she was poorly.... Yeah.... Mm.... I
mean, he said to us m- me daughter ‘any time night or day you want me
call me’.... Mm.... Well me wife died at home. Five o clock in the
mor- morning.... I was lucky that night that I had erm a nurse f- from
who was with me.... Yeah.... Cos I wouldn’t have known what to do on
me own properly.... Mm.... Mm.... So I rang me daughter up. She came
and she said ‘I’m going to ring the vicar’.... Yeah.... And he was w-
with us within half an hour.... Really? Aw.... So he- he- he was good
on that side.... Yeah.... When you really needed him he was there and
I think being a church m- member has helped me a lot in life....
Mm.... I- I’m very honest. I’m very sincere. I talk a lot.... I l- I
like to listen to you you know. I like to listen to you you know....
I’ve got hundreds of stories that I can’t- I... But is it- an- nearly
up yet?... **inc** yeah.
