doing- right, then I dunno Games you played when you were a kid. EOS
Oh, skipping Erm there was one called erm Rallyvo. Used to throw a
ball at the wall er and try and hit you with it, I think EOS Was
that-? EOS Hopscotch. That was always a good one. Used to play horses
EOS me friends used to gallop round the playground. EOS That was
always a good one. And we used to play- EOS What, on top of each
other? EOS No EOS no. Just used to chase and make this noise . EOS
Good fun EOS I don’t particularly remember them doing that in my
school. EOS What did you play? EOS Er, football. EOS Football. EOS
Continuously. EOS Non-stop. EOS From morning to night. EOS Erm right,
erm-. EOS Amd we used to play on the railway. EOS ooh EOS That’s not
good. EOS On the sidings. Pinching things from Kelloggs. EOS Stoning
trains, was always a good one. EOS Oh my god what? EOS Putting stones
on the track. EOS Oh my god! That’s terrible. EOS Setting fire to the
grass, that was always good fun. EOS That’s what we used to do as
kids. EOS Oh we didn’t. EOS Kids are mollycoddled now they couldn’t go
anywhere near the railway. EOS Well my very favourite game was playing
school in my friend’s shed. EOS yeah, EOS That used to be brilliant.
Used to be four of us. EOS aww EOS Great times. I was always the
teacher. EOS Cos I was the oldest . Anyway, did you help out around
the house a lot, when you were a kid? EOS Never. EOS Never? EOS Never
did anything whatsoever. My mum used to do the lot. EOS Well we did.
EOS I wouldn’t be in the house anyway cos I’d be out playing. EOS
Football. EOS Football. On the railway. EOS Setting fire to the grass.
EOS On the canal playing with my air rifle. Another thing kids
couldn’t do these days. EOS Shooting things. Smashing bottles, killing
birds. Sparrows, starlings, songbirds. EOS I’m surprised you’re not in
prison now. EOS Anything that moved, basically. Each other sometimes.
EOS I’m surprised you’re not in prison now. EOS Ah it’s my education
that kept me out. EOS Going rabbiting, EOS friend’s dog, little Jack
Russell. If I was allowed to go. Always cliques in gangs. Some people
can do things, some other people can’t. Bigger lads always used to go,
sometimes we could tag along. That was good fun. EOS Killing rabbits?
EOS Killing rabbits, EOS killing rabbits, yeah. EOS Watching the dog
get them. EOS Oh my god. EOS Flushing them out with the ferrets. EOS
Really? EOS Yeah that’s what you do, put a ferret down the hole, wait
for it to flush the rabbit out, and then the dog would go and get the
rabbit. EOS Oh my god Right then. EOS While you were playing school,
we couldn’t wait to get out of school. EOS And you’re finishing school
and going to play it. EOS Loved it, it was great fun Big thing was
getting all the- it used to be a really big thing if you used to get a
new pad and pencils and pens and- used to share them all out and used
to set homework and- It was good fun, used to love it. Had a
blackboard in there as well, and- cos I was the oldest, and that was a
time, I remember running home, I was only about ten or eleven and I
was in a rush, they were all waiting for me at the door. And I tripped
over a towel EOS oh no EOS over the banister, and fell down the stairs
from top to bottom and broke my arm. Remember that, EOS God EOS yeah I
was about ten, ten or eleven years old when that happened. Anyway EOS
No permanent damage done then. EOS No EOS Didn’t hit your head did
you? EOS Yes I did. I did hit my head, but- EOS Ah well maybe that
explains a few things then. EOS there was no lasting damage. No
lasting damage anyway. So you didn’t do anything to help out at home?
Nothing at all? EOS Never. EOS Nothing. EOS Nope. EOS We had to, to
get spends. EOS yeah EOS Nope. EOS So if we didn’t do our jobs, we
didn’t get spends. End of. EOS Used to help an elderly neighbour for
cash. EOS God what a different childhood we had. EOS erm- EOS I- I
take it you used to help out then did you? EOS An awful lot. Yeah, yes
I did. EOS ooh, sorry, I’ll just get that EOS Erm what is your best or
funniest memory from when you were a child? EOS But- but what did you
do then? Helping out. EOS What at home? EOS Yeah, you’re saying, ‘oh
well yeah I helped out a lot,’ but what did you do to help out? EOS We
used to have to Ewbank the carpet, cos I wasn’t allowed to use the
hoover cos I used into bang into the furniture too much with it. EOS
What’s a Ewbank? EOS A Ewbank? EOS A Ewbank, what’s a Ewbank? EOS A
Ewbank- A Ewbank is like a hoover with no motor. Used to push it up
and down, up and down, up and down. EOS What sucking, making sucking
noises like a horsey game? EOS No, no No used to just push it up and
down up and down, it used to hoover everything but without a motor.
EOS You- you just- EOS It had brushes on it. So I used to have to
Ewbank the carpet and then we used to have to polish, but EOS Did you
make the noise of the hoover when you were Ewbanking? EOS No we didn’t
used to make the noise of the hoover, no we didn’t. Erm, yeah
polishing, washing pots. But we had to do that properly. Otherwise, if
we didn’t do it properly, then we didn’t get our spends. EOS ahh EOS
She used to dock us money. Erm-. EOS Do you think Dyson could make a
Ewbank? EOS oh n- now no I’m talking about in th- in the seventies.
Everyone had a Ewbank. Did you not? EOS I don’t remember one. EOS I
remember you had a Ewbank. EOS How do you know? You wasn’t there! EOS
But you and me have been together thirty odd years, so yeah I remember
when me and you were courting. EOS well I- EOS You had a Ewbank in
your house. EOS I’m sure it was orange. EOS Well I never u- EOS or
that could’ve been mine EOS well I never used it. EOS Well you
wouldn’t have used it because you didn’t do anything to help your mum.
But- yes you did! EOS he used to make fairy cakes with his mum. EOS
aww EOS That’s not helping me mum. EOS Well what is it then? EOS That
was making food EOS for me to eat. EOS So did you used to cook with
your mum? EOS Occasionally. That was-. EOS And what did you used to
make? EOS Eve’s Pudding. EOS And-? EOS Fairy cakes. EOS Ah. And what
happened, what did your brothers used to do to you? EOS Used to tease
me. EOS aww EOS And they used to-? EOS Punch me. EOS Batter him EOS
aww EOS Well the older one would. EOS And called him a girl. EOS Yeah
they all wanted some of the fairy cakes. EOS Wouldn’t say that now
they see- now they see Gordon Ramsey they wouldn’t be saying that,
would they? EOS No you’re quite right. EOS If I’d have followed that
path maybe I wouldn’t be here now. EOS maybe. EOS Bigger and better
things. EOS oh . EOS I might’ve been a better cook than you, I
probably am a better cook than you, but that’s-. EOS I’m a
professional! EOS That’s something else. EOS So then this will be an
easy one for you. Because er- your grandparents- did your grandparents
ever tell you any stories? EOS Lots and lots of stories. EOS What,
your granddad told you stories? EOS Yes he did. My grandfather was
known as the storyteller. EOS Aww EOS In our house, wasn’t he? About
how he was lost at sea in the merchant navy for a year, and presumed
dead. EOS God EOS and then he just turned up. EOS Really? EOS erm- EOS
Wasn’t during the war, was it? EOS Yes it was, was it not in the war?
I can’t remember. My granddad was **anon** they lived in er EOS ahh
EOS **anon** EOS In some countries they call it deserting, don’t they?
EOS He did not desert! He did not desert. He wasn’t- he was captured,
his ship got blown up and they were rescued and- and then they lived
somewhere, I can’t remember. EOS Were they captured by members of
their own family? EOS No, no they weren’t. Oh you’re talking about
that granddad. My granddad **anon**. EOS No not the Irish side, not
the first world war side. EOS He was a deserter. EOS Really? EOS I
think so. I don’t know the whole story about that but EOS yeah EOS he
changed- changed his name, the- the spelling of the surname so they
couldn’t trace him or something. EOS But I don’t know why they did
that. EOS Probably so they didn’t have to fight. EOS I don’t know,
anyway. EOS How about your family? EOS Yeah they told me stories yeah.
EOS About-? EOS My father told me a story about when he was shot in
the neck. EOS Yeah, and we all believed him. EOS Well you would
believe him, he’s got a hole in his neck where he was shot. EOS And
what was the hole really? EOS It was er tuberculosis. EOS oh EOS Given
to him by cow’s milk I believe. EOS And we all believed him. When I
first started going out with Martin **anon** he told me he’d been shot
in the neck. EOS Yeah. EOS I was fifteen and er for maybe twenty
years, EOS is it twenty years, I believed him. All that time. EOS mm
EOS That he’d been shot in the neck, but his mum was shot, EOS really?
EOS she had shap- shrapnel in her legs, she’s **anon** Martin’s
**anon** mum. And er when the- when the planes came over, and the-
they were shooting in the fields or something, weren’t they? EOS My
mum wasn’t shooting. EOS no EOS She was picking- she was picking
potatoes. EOS the English yeah in a field. EOS Little girl picking-
picking potatoes in a field and er a hurricane pilot decided she was a
legitimate target. EOS oh, no EOS And er opened the machines gun- EOS
shot down EOS machine guns at her. EOS Yeah. EOS And she ended up with
shrapnel in the top of her thigh. EOS Yeah. EOS oh, no EOS yeah. She
told us some right stories, your mum didn’t she? From- she had it
really hard. EOS yeah EOS There’s I think nine of them, wasn’t there?
Something- was there nine brothers and sisters. EOS Something like
yeah. EOS And it really, really hard eating frozen potatoes out of the
ground when they were kids. EOS gosh EOS And yeah, in Germany Mm
must’ve been hard for her. EOS Not like me you see. Privileged life
that we lead. EOS mm, true EOS Some of us more than others. EOS mmhmm,
erm, how many brothers and sisters do you have? And did you get along
with each other when you were kids? EOS No EOS none of them. Youngest
brother probably, eldest brother used to bully me, EOS aww EOS tease
me, together with my dad. EOS And me younger brother. EOS So you were
picked on by all of them. EOS All of them, middle child, EOS aww EOS
typical. EOS I used to batter my brother, EOS did you? EOS seven years
between us. EOS I used to batter him all the time EOS aww EOS Make him
do things to- for me, or I’d torture him. EOS Chinese burns EOS He was
only little. EOS aww EOS Oh how horrible! Still don’t get on now EOS
No that’s not true. That’s not true, we do get on, so EOS So can you
describe what a Chinese burn actually is? EOS It’s it’s- give me your
wrist and I’ll show you. EOS That- it’s no good for the tape is it?
Showing. EOS No well you used to grab the wrists with your two hands
EOS yeah EOS and you used to go like that. EOS ooh EOS And it used to
burn. Used to twist the skin on your wrist EOS What in opposite
directions? EOS Yes. In opposite directions, and you used to scream.
EOS But my most favourite one to do with him EOS was the cow bite. Was
to grab him like that and squeeze dead hard, until he’d shift from the
chair. We always used to fight where we used to sit you see. EOS Yeah.
EOS So- that’s what we used to do. EOS Well my brother used to give me
cow bites. I used to hate him. EOS I’m sure my brother used to hate
me. EOS Used to give me cow bites on the back of the arm, just pinch
the back of the arm. EOS Urgh, ow. EOS And he used to think it was
funny. And I used to scream. EOS and I used to think it was funny and
he used to scream. But then me dad would always intervene and I’d get
battered off me dad. I; EOS Think my dad used to join in. EOS I think
these days they’d call it child abuse. EOS ahh EOS I’m gonna ask him
when I see him now EOS Yeah I can remember- and punishment from me
mum. Always used to hand out the beatings. EOS Slippers, cane. EOS the
flat back of a hairbrush. EOS ooh EOS Oh, ouch. She’s quite torturous,
his mother. EOS ahh EOS Isn’t she, she’s- threw a turtle on the fire.
EOS Turtle? Why? EOS Cos she thought it was dead and it was
hibernating. EOS oh, no EOS Didn’t she? EOS Say, it’s not funny is it?
EOS No No it’s not. Now there was the kitten down the toilet. EOS What
do you mean, kittens down the toilet? EOS She told me she used to put
kittens- oh no in a bucket of water. EOS she w- EOS When she was- when
they were a kid on the farm. There were too many cats. That’s what her
dad used to do. dunk them in a bucket of water. Didn’t she? EOS She
did yeah. She had a terrible accident one day with her favourite
little kitten. When she closed the door without looking and her
favourite little fluffy kitten got in the way. EOS Oh no! EOS Squished
its head. EOS Mm, mincemeat. EOS That was horrible. EOS Not very nice.
EOS And the budgie. EOS Oh we had a budgie, happy bird it was
absolutely fantastic, EOS ahh EOS used to pick your teeth. EOS he did
EOS Sit on your shoulder, come to you whenever you called him. EOS On
your cup of tea, he’d stand on your cup of tea. Didn’t he? EOS Yep,
he’d been rescued. Flown into my sister-in-law’s office. And she
brought him home and we kept him. And then me dad decided to give him
an airing, outside in his cage. And the cat got on top of the cage.
EOS ah, no EOS And we never seen happy bird ever again. EOS aww EOS
Not very good at keeping animals were you really? EOS I wasn’t bad.
EOS We had a cat called Ginger and my dad used to call him fleabag.
EOS And he got run over and lost his leg, his front paw. EOS aww EOS
What colour was he? EOS Ginger EOS and he used to be full of fleas EOS
So you called him Ginger and fleabag. EOS Fleabag, ‘go away fleabag!’
Used to go mad at him, always clawing. I had a guinea pig when I was
really little. Me dad hated that as well. EOS Oh no EOS Mm. He died.
EOS How could he hate a guinea pig? EOS He just used to hate him, he
used to say he was dead noisy. But that was from when I was really
little, when I lived in **anon**. And I left there when I was seven or
eight, I think I was. I remember the hutch in the back- in the back
yard next to the toilet. Cos we had an outside toilet. EOS Oh EOS
yeah, Squeaks. EOS What was it like then, using your outside toilet?
EOS Can’t remember really, I was only little. But we had an inside one
as well. EOS Two toilets? EOS Yeah yeah EOS Did you used to live in a
mansion when you lived in **anon**? EOS No no, two up, two down. EOS
With- two up two down with two toilets? EOS No there was a toilet
outside and then there was my mum and dad’s bedroom and then there was
my bedroom and then there was a wall with a door in that me dad put up
and there was a toilet in there. Upstairs but you had to come through
my bedroom to get to the toilet. EOS So you used to have an ensuite? I
EOS Yeah. EOS So whilst the only person in the country with ensuite
was the Queen, EOS [laugh EOS you also had one? EOS It was the toilet
upstairs. Definitely. With glass at the top and this studded wall.
Horrible it was. EOS So an inside toilet was horrible? While I’m going
outside EOS in the depths of winter. EOS Did you not have an inside
toilet? EOS No we didn’t have an inside toilet no. EOS That toilet
that you’ve got now? That’s an inside toilet. EOS I can remember it-
that’s- that’s a- that’s an inside toilet that’s been turned round
from the outside. EOS oh right. EOS Originally that was an outside
toilet. With red walls that had been speckled with paint, like you’d
do in school. To splash on the paper. EOS And that’s what we used to
have. With a nail. EOS Get lost! EOS Nail. EOS You’ll be saying
newspaper next. EOS And newspaper. Newspaper. EOS No you did not. EOS
Cut up into sheets. EOS That’s not true! EOS That’s true. Izal. EOS Oh
we used to have, Izal. EOS Don’t sound proud of it! EOS Izal was- EOS
It’s nothing to be proud of, to have Izal. EOS Izal was paper. EOS oh
EOS It was horrible. It was, you had to scrunch it all up first. Oh it
was nasty. EOS That was luxu- that was luxury, we had- when we had the
Izal in that was like our luxury, rather than the newspaper. That was
like a good day. If you went in there and there was Izal in there that
was like, ‘yeah it must be pay day.’ EOS We were posher than Martin
**anon** in our family EOS oh, okay EOS because we went to-. EOS
You’ll have come from **anon**, you couldn’t have been- oh no you did
have two toilets didn’t you? EOS Yes we did and we went to Majorca EOS
ooh EOS when I was little. With me **anon** and **anon** on a plane
and I was about eight or nine. And I remember sitting next to the pool
eating calamari. EOS Rings, chewy rings. Got- still got the
photographs of that. EOS I do- EOS I had an orange and yellow dress
on, that me nanna made. EOS Aww. EOS Mm, and a towelling bikini, with
spots EOS So you were there in nineteen seventy two, eating cala-
what, EOS calamari EOS cala-who-dri? EOS Roll of squid. I remember- I
remember it really, really well. EOS And you were calling them
calamari in nineteen seventy two? EOS No we weren’t calling them that,
it was squid. Yeah, remember it. EOS So you had a toilet upstairs. EOS
We did. EOS And you used to go on foreign holidays. EOS We did go on
one. EOS And eat calamari. EOS Only one foreign holiday. EOS I bet you
were drinking wine as well, wasn’t you? EOS No, no that was when I was
a bit older cos like I say with being Mediterranean in the family, we
all had wine. Two fingers EOS mm EOS two fingers of wine in the glass,
topped up with lemonade or water. EOS ahh EOS mm EOS And there’s me
being dragged off to me bleeding grandmas in Windsor, into a tower
block. EOS aww, ahh, EOS Really? EOS Yeah, really yeah. The old fifth
floor of a tower block or something. That was my summer holidays. EOS
That was only one, with me **anon** and me **anon** that I remember
that early. EOS Unless it was every year, this. EOS No we didn’t get
holiday every year. Isle of Man. EOS Wasn’t an holiday it was like
punishment. EOS I remember going to the Isle of Man. EOS did you not
used to go to **anon**? EOS That was when I was older. I was just
visiting family then, not holiday I was visiting family. EOS whe- EOS
‘Go- go to **anon**, go to **anon** and watch your granddad die.’ Ah,
so EOS Oh my god. EOS That’s what we did. EOS Where in **anon** is it?
EOS It was er near EOS Oh okay. EOS **anon**, **anon**. We had a good
time it was nice meeting family. EOS yeah EOS Watching your granddad
die. EOS Couldn’t under- watching me granddad die. Couldn’t understand
a word they said. EOS But yeah, enjoyed it Not Windsor, I didn’t,
that’s a bit rubbish. EOS Well other than going round the castle, the
castle was alright. EOS mm EOS Just me and me younger brother then so
I wouldn’t be bullied all the time. M; Remember having a bath once
with my sister, well I wasn’t bathing with my sister. That would be a
bit weird, wouldn’t it? EOS But she bathed me, I don’t know, she
would’ve been quite old as well, maybe twelve or thirteen. Twelve
probably I’d have been about eight. And for a laugh she poured sco-
scolding water on me head. EOS I don’t know if it was cold water first
or hot water. But whatever it was, she told me to stop complaining and
put the other one on top of me head afterwards. EOS Oh god . EOS It’s
no wonder I’m a twisted individual I suppose. EOS See that’s my
childhood, see? EOS You had a terrible childhood didn’t you? EOS Yeah
so did your **anon**. So did your brother. Being bullied by you,
that’s how he- EOS Oh my god it was a bit of a flipping- EOS That’s
how he feels. I’m sure that’s how he feels. That’s why he’s gone to
America. EOS Aww . EOS Because he had to leave because he couldn’t
stay in this country any more. EOS Do you know what I did do which was
really bad? This is terrible this. He bought my mum- there used to be
a chocolate bar called a nutty. And it- it was like caramel- EOS That
sounds attractive that. EOS that’s what they were called, do you
remember nuttys? EOS No, could never afford chocolates. EOS And it was
caramel EOS and it was wrapped in like peanuts and he bought it me mum
for mother’s day and kept it in the cupboard. He bought it with his
spends. And I’ll never forget, oh I can’t believe I did this, but I
stole it and I ate it. EOS Cos I wanted this chocolate bar so, so
much. And I denied all knowledge for- it was up until a couple of
years ago. EOS Really? EOS I told him the truth. He always used to say
to me, ‘you did take that nutty, didn’t you?’ And I used to go, ‘no I
didn’t!’ and I did. EOS aww EOS And it was only a few years ago when-
cos I go and visit him maybe once a year. Or once every two years, I
can’t- EOS yeah EOS and I told him the truth. And he was really upset
with me. EOS Yeah, was he? EOS Yeah, cos he EOS aww EOS Well he would
be. Cos all he wanted to do as a child was please his mum. EOS Yeah
give- EOS give it her for mother’s day. EOS All I wanted to do was
please my mum, make cakes with my mum, and I got teased and ridiculed.
EOS And all he wanted to do was buy his mum a chocolate bar. And give
it for mother’s day, was it? EOS Yeah. EOS Aww. EOS And then somebody
nasty and older went and spoilt it. EOS I got her milk tray. EOS
Spoilt his special day. EOS It’s terrible. EOS His day with his mum.
EOS And I can- I remember I got my mum a box of milk tray and you got
a free happy mother’s day card with it. And when she died she still-
when we were going through all her stuff, we found it, she’d kept it
all that time. EOS Really, aww that’s nice. EOS All that time, she
kept it. And this little card as well, best mum in the world. Couldn’t
believe she kept it all that time. EOS She probably was quite- I
dunno, a bit er- surprised that you’d been so nice for once. EOS I was
a very nice daughter. EOS Cos she’d probably see all the things that
you did to your brother and- but you continued to- well you always
liked chocolate didn’t you? EOS Doing things with chocolate EOS I know
it’s not about childhood because you know, when- when I had my easter
egg. EOS oh don’t tell her that! EOS Remember I had my easter egg?
When we were married. And you got me an easter egg. EOS Yes. EOS On
easter Sunday morning. EOS Yes I remember. EOS And I’d had it about
two minutes EOS and you went all moody, EOS aww EOS and stamped on it,
stamped on it like a little child in front of me, didn’t you? EOS
Stamping your feet over and over again until the easter egg was
crushed. Didn’t you? EOS Why? EOS I can’t remember now. I can’t
remember why. EOS You can’t rememb- you can’t remember doing it, oh
did you blank it out? EOS No I can remember, I can remember doing it
very clearly. EOS you blank it out, that’s what I tried to do when-, I
tried to blank it out when nasty things happen to you, that’s what you
try to do. EOS aww EOS Oh I can’t- EOS but, yeah EOS I can’t remember
why I did that now. Why you annoyed me so much. EOS mm, I have my
ideas why you did it but-. EOS Why, tell me why! Cos you didn’t get me
one? EOS I don’t think that was the reason. EOS I can’t remember. EOS
I think it’s just about your wiring, isn’t it? EOS Er where are your
parents from? Oh we’ve established that really, haven’t we? EOS Well
my dad’s not **anon** is he? EOS No go on! Where are your parents
from? EOS That’s if they are my parents. EOS oh God EOS I always had
the feeling I was adopted because there was- I took so much abuse when
I was a child. EOS I always felt there was something different about
me. EOS ah EOS ah EOS As if I’d been abused, not abused but as if I’d
been- I’d come from somewhere else. EOS But you and your brother are
spitting image of each other! EOS I know but it wasn’t like that when
I was a kid. EOS With your big freaky head. EOS They used to- they
used to say I had a big head, yeah. EOS He had a huge head. EOS Oh
really? EOS Yeah with the biggest afro you’ve ever seen in your life,
it used to ‘.’ I; EOS What does ‘’ mean? EOS Your head, your hair used
to move before your head did. . EOS your brother told me! EOS What, me
brother told that mey head used to go ‘?’ EOS He said your head- your
afro was that big it used to wave in the wind. EOS But if it was
windy, what if it wasn’t windy? EOS I don’t know. So where’s your dad
from? EOS He’s English, from Salford. EOS My dad was born in Salford.
Wasn’t he? And lived in **anon**. M’: That’s a nice move that, isn’t
it? EOS mm EOS yeah EOS From dirty Salford to the suburbs of **anon**.
Is that where he got the idea of a second bathroom from? EOS From
living in **anon**? EOS There was a toilet upstairs, there was a
toilet upstairs. EOS How did he move from **anon** to **anon** then?
To the slums of **anon**? EOS It was not a slum! EOS It was a slum,
that was why you moved cos they pulled it down. EOS Knocking the
houses down, because my dad used to work for a company called
**anon**. EOS Erm and I think the houses, I’m not- I’m not too sure
about that. I know all the houses were originally built for the
factories weren’t they, that were there. For the factory workers. But
I’m sure it was my mum and dad’s house. You know I’m pretty sure it
was and they moved us to **anon**. Cos they were pulling them all
down. EOS mm, ah EOS But they didn’t pull them down for about five
years, did they? EOS No. EOS Moved everybody out and then didn’t pull
them down EOS . EOS Well they put Asians in them didn’t they? EOS Did
they? EOS That’s what they did, yeah. Immigrants. EOS But happy, happy
childhood my best friends, **anon**, **anon** and **anon** used to
live across the road. EOS Oh that’s nice. EOS Yeah, I remember that,
playing with the prams having races down the street with our prams.
Playing cricket in the entry. Couldn’t play cricket now but . EOS How
do you play- how do you play cricket without ca- being able to catch a
ball? EOS I can catch a ball. EOS I can catch a ball. EOS But you
couldn’t on holiday. I; oh, EOS Oh here we go again. EOS Well you
couldn’t! You couldn’t catch-. EOS He was on holiday, he was throwing
this ball at me in the sea, and he was skidding it so it was like
that, ‘.’ EOS ahh EOS And it was splashing all the water in your face.
EOS yeah EOS Well you’re like that shutting your eyes, and you can’t
catch a ball with your eyes shut. EOS Is that those really small ones?
EOS Yeah. EOS Yeah **anon** was saying. EOS yeah EOS It was fantastic.
EOS Him and **anon** played for-. EOS extreme. EOS mm EOS Throwing it
at each other. EOS yeah EOS Pathetic. I EOS For about an hour, nearly
put your shoulder out. EOS But that was the thing, catch the ball EOS
So yes I can catch a ball EOS Shall we move on now, do you want to
move on? EOS Do you want to move on? School days, go to school days!
EOS You had nice catholic schools, didn’t you? EOS I did. EOS That
must’ve been nice. EOS **anon** EOS Bet the n- nuns were nice, weren’t
they? EOS no evil. EOS Really? EOS **anon** in particular. EOS Why?
EOS Evil, evil-. EOS I wouldn’t mention any names Janice **anon**,
but- EOS What? Oh. EOS No it’s okay it gets edited out. EOS Oh that’s
okay. EOS I was only kidding her. EOS She’s- she was terrible. She’s
really, really evil. Used to- she had a knack, she used to throw the
board rubber and she used to get you every time. EOS ooh EOS It just-
it- there had to be complete silence in the classroom and if you dared
ask someone next to you for a pencil or- EOS yeah EOS oh my god, you
used to get it. And you used to have to stand in the corner- there was
a teacher called er **anon** and your nose had to be on the wall, like
that which- just stand there, all through the lesson. Until she was
ready for you to sit back down. EOS God EOS She was evil, horrible
woman, horrible. EOS That’d be child abuse now I’m sure it would be.
Can’t touch them now. EOS No. EOS Erm, how about you at school? EOS
Loved it EOS **anon**. EOS He’s really clever he went to a grammar
school, didn’t you? EOS ooh EOS It wasn’t me first scho- they didn’t
put me straight to grammar school. EOS I had to- I had to do infants
and juniors first. EOS At **anon**? EOS Lovely, yeah. EOS I loved my
school, **anon**, and then **anon**. EOS You got bullied at school,
didn’t you? EOS A little bit yeah Mm, I did. EOS Is that why you used
to- is that why you used to go home and bully your brother? EOS You
used to- but- EOS but you used to be a bully at school. EOS I didn’t
bully anybody EOS Pardon? EOS I didn’t bully I was just a bit rougher
than the other kids. EOS Is that not a bully? EOS Didn’t bully them,
no I didn’t bully them. EOS You used to batter anyone? EOS Just
everybody- no people just used to have their place. EOS And you were
the top of the pack, were you? EOS Mm, top bit of it, yeah. EOS Top
ten percent. That’s just the way school was. Bit like that in life.
EOS Suppose yeah, it is. EOS Do you remember your first day at school?
EOS No. EOS I bet you had shiny shoes on, didn’t you? EOS aww EOS New
shiny shoes. EOS I remember my first day at secondary school. When I
was eleven. I do remember that. Me nanna and granddad bought me this
bloody briefcase. EOS I just wanted a backpack, like everyone else.
EOS Yeah. EOS That’s all I wanted was this backpack. But my nanna and
granddad- well it was me granddad, he’d gone to London to see his
mother. EOS And it was them in the house that had give him this
briefcase that used to be my uncle’s. EOS oh, no EOS Oh god and it was
brown and it was horrible, EOS with this big buckle thing on the
front, oh I hated it so much, and I had to take it to school. And they
just laughed their heads off at me. EOS aww EOS I hated it. Hated it
so much. EOS I wish I’d have had one like that. EOS What did you have?
EOS I had a briefcase, it didn’t sound as nice as that one. EOS Oh
Martin **anon** it was awful. It was brown, like dark- like- like a
tan brown. It was so noticeable. Oh and it used to make this clicking
noise, oh god. Yeah you couldn’t even open it quiet EOS it’s all
coming back oh no EOS you couldn’t even open it quiet. everyone used
to look. EOS What did you used to keep in there? EOS My lovely
pencils. Cos I used to love my pencils and my felt tip pens. EOS And
my books. And me dinner tickets. EOS I bet you used to like dinner
didn’t you? Dinnertimes. EOS Did you used to like dinnertimes? EOS I
was dead skinny then I was, I was really skinny. EOS Yeah that’s
because you liked dinnertimes, that’s because- but you loved school
dinners didn’t you? EOS I did yeah. EOS Cos you became a school dinner
lady. EOS yeah. EOS I am a catering manager thank you very much. EOS I
manage the kitchen. EOS Yeah we’ll call it-. EOS I manage my cook, and
my washer uppers. EOS And you do some cooking as well. EOS I do
cooking, I do the c- I do the main meals, yes. EOS Do you now- do you
er- bring back your old favourites? You know, the stuff that you used
to like when you were a kid? Do you now cook that same stuff for the
children that you’re cooking for now? EOS Yeah, things like rice
pudding, tapioca, erm lemon sponge and custard. Chocolate sponge with
mint custard, that’s one of the favourites. EOS Do you think the
chemicals in the mint custard- EOS Do you think they could affect
children? EOS Er no it’s a mint- it’s a mint erm essence. EOS where-
EOS It’s a pure- pure mint essences we use. EOS Where do they get the
luminous green colour from? EOS Erm it’s a food colourant. Yeah but we
use one teaspoon for four gallons of custard. EOS That must be pretty
powerful stuff. EOS yeah EOS It is cos it only ever hi- hi- a tinge of
green, if I make it too green, they won’t have it. EOS Do you think if
you ate a spoonful of that green colouring, EOS mm, mm EOS do you
think you’d turn green? EOS If you took it neat? EOS Yeah. EOS I’m
sure it would do irreparable damage to your insides. EOS What about
your skin tone though? EOS But watered down- EOS well they do say if
you eat beta carotene, which is a natural food colourant in carrots,
that it is in tanning tablets and that’s what makes you go brown. EOS
mm EOS If you take enough of them, yeah EOS Do you think that there’s
Martians somewhere that- I dunno, on some planet outer universe, that
are green coloured, but only light green, that they might take this
green food colouring to tan them up. EOS . EOS Do you think there’d be
same type of-? EOS You’re very weird. EOS Tablets for martians? EOS
no. EOS So like you’d be like a light green martian but you’re
thinking, ‘I want to look like I’ve been on my holidays, so I’ll take
a little mouthful of Janice’s **anon** special green food colouring
and that’ll green me up.’ EOS No I don’t. EOS just no EOS yeah, that’s
a very, very weird thing to ask. EOS Anyway what else do I make? Make
all sorts of favourites, cobbler, minced beef cobbler they like. EOS
What was your favourite school meal? EOS When I was at school? EOS
Yeah what did you used to look for? You’re in the queue-. EOS Gypsy
pie. EOS Obviously you’re probably bullying a little kid in front of
you. EOS I never bullied EOS Chinese burn EOS yeah EOS yeah I never
bullied at school. EOS I was bullied. EOS Chinese burns, cow bite. EOS
No I was never- I never ever bullied at school. But my favourite thing
at school was gypsy pie. It was the best thing ever. My mum tried to
make it and she could never make it the same. EOS What’s a gypsy pie?
EOS Gypsy pie is pastry, jam, and then a mixture of desiccated coconut
and golden syrup. And one or two other bits and bobs in it. EOS Yeah,
mm that sounds nice. EOS And cornflakes, all mished together and you
put it on top and it’s just divine. EOS Couldn’t eat it now. But er-
and we used to have er mince and onion pie as well EOS nice EOS at
school with mashed potatoes and gravy. That was another big, big
favourite, cos my mum never used to make pies. EOS yeah EOS I used to

didn’t they? Sugar on it underneath. Shortbread. EOS I never had one.
EOS You never had one? EOS I used to sp- No, I used to spend my money
on cigarettes. EOS Martin **anon** EOS Well that’s what you did, start
smoking at eight. EOS Eight EOS I don’t know what you’re laughing at.
EOS That’s when kids started smoking then. EOS oh, God EOS Pinch them
off your mum. Pinch money out of your mum’s purse. EOS oh my god! EOS
Cos I didn’t do any jobs for her, she was never gonna give me spends,
was she? EOS So I used to pinch money out of my mum’s purse. EOS my,
God Martin **anon**. EOS And we’d all go- we’d all go home after

corner shop. And they used to climb over the wall, pinch the bottles,
take the bottles, come back over, go into the front of the shop, give
the shop keeper the bottles and we used to get five p back for them

probably. In old money. EOS For his own- for his own- from his own
bottles. EOS aww EOS Terrible, you were really bad you EOS I wasn’t
really- it was normal we were just normal kids. EOS Never got in
trouble cos we didn’t get caught. EOS that’s okay then EOS Yeah, erm.

And they stopped doing it because of, is it BSM? BS- BS- EOS Er
British School of Motoring? EOS No EOS oh what’s it called? EOS The-
the- the-. EOS Mad cow disease. EOS I don’t think that had anything to
do with it. EOS Are you sure I thought that’s why they stopped doing
them. EOS I am sure yeah. EOS No white dog poo went long before then.
EOS Did it? EOS I think they just put- stopped putting calcium in the
dog food. Don’t know what reason. EOS So yeah, you don’t see white dog
poo any more. EOS No you don’t EOS Apart from my dog, who only has
white dog poo. EOS Really. EOS Cos all he eats is raw chicken EOS oh
EOS and bones, doesn’t he? EOS mm EOS aww EOS Did you have a favourite
teacher at school? I know you got the nasty ones, the nuns. Little mob
